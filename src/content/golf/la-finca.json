    "heroIntro": "La Finca Golf Resort stands as one of Costa Blanca South's premier golf destinations, combining championship-quality golf with an exceptional residential community. Designed by renowned Spanish architect Pepe Gancedo and opened in 2002, this parkland-style 18-hole course has become synonymous with quality golf lifestyle in the Vega Baja region.\n\nSet within the peaceful municipality of Algorfa, La Finca offers everything golfers seek: a challenging yet fair layout, excellent year-round conditions, a welcoming clubhouse, and crucially, access to quality new build properties at prices significantly below coastal alternatives.",
    "courseSection": {
      "intro": "La Finca's 18-hole championship course presents a thoroughly enjoyable test for golfers of all abilities. The parkland layout stretches across undulating terrain, with mature palm trees framing generous fairways and strategic water features adding both beauty and challenge.",
      "features": [
        "18 holes, Par 72, measuring 6,027 meters from championship tees",

        "Practice facilities including driving range, putting and chipping greens"
      ],
      "description": "Pepe Gancedo's design philosophy is evident throughout: the course rewards thoughtful play without punishing the higher handicapper excessively. Each hole offers multiple routes to the green, encouraging strategic thinking over raw power.\n\nSignature holes include the par-3 7th, where water guards the entire front of the green, and the par-5 18th, which brings water into play twice and provides a dramatic finishing test. But there's not a weak hole on the course—Gancedo crafted 18 interesting challenges.\n\nConditions are maintained to a consistently high standard. The greens run true and at reasonable pace, while the fairways provide excellent lies. Even in peak summer, when some courses struggle, La Finca's irrigation systems keep the course in excellent shape."
