    "investmentSection": "MASCARAT BAY VIEWS represents an exceptional investment opportunity in a market demonstrating robust growth. Costa Blanca property values have increased +7% year-on-year, with Calpe leading this appreciation due to infrastructure improvements, including the forthcoming TRAM system. Properties in Mascarat command approximately 20% lower prices than comparable developments in nearby Jávea, offering significant value for both owner-occupiers and investors. The rental market is particularly strong, with similar properties commanding €1,000+ per week during peak season, generating excellent annual returns. The combination of strong international demand, limited supply of quality new builds, and ongoing infrastructure development creates favorable conditions for capital appreciation. BOGSA's established reputation and the development's premium positioning in Mascarat ensure long-term value stability and growth potential.",
