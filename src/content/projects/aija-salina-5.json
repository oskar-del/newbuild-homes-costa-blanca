      "intro": "Pueblo in Rojales represents one of Costa Blanca's most authentic and vibrant communities, offering the perfect blend of traditional Spanish charm and modern international living. Located in the heart of the region, this established area has become increasingly popular with both European expatriates and Spanish families seeking a genuine Mediterranean lifestyle without the over-development of coastal zones. The town provides excellent amenities within walking or short driving distances, including supermarkets, restaurants, healthcare facilities, and leisure attractions. The international community here is well-established with English widely spoken, making integration seamless for foreign buyers. Rojales benefits from its strategic inland location, offering cooler summers, lower property costs compared to beachfront developments, and a slower pace of life while remaining just minutes from stunning coastlines. The region's investment potential continues to grow, with infrastructure improvements and rising property values making it an increasingly attractive destination for savvy property buyers.",
