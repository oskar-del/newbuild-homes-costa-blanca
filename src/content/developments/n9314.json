    {
      "question": "Can foreigners buy property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners enjoy equal property purchasing rights to Spanish nationals. No residency requirement or citizenship exists for property acquisition.

    },
    {

      "question": "What makes La Fustera a premium location?",
      "answer": "La Fustera distinguishes itself through dramatic coastal scenery, established reputation for quality residential properties, blue flag beach access, and presence of international residents seeking authentic Mediterranean living without tourist infrastructure.
