  "heroIntro": "This exceptional 3-bedroom villa in Polop Hills represents a rare opportunity for discerning buyers seeking premium specification at compelling value. At €4,056 per square meter, this property delivers sophisticated coastal living at 40% less than comparable developments across Spanish island markets—a significant advantage for buyers prioritizing investment potential alongside lifestyle excellence.\n\nPolop has emerged as the preferred destination for luxury property seekers who recognize the distinction between overcrowded coastal developments and authentic Mediterranean living. This villa embodies that philosophy: exclusive, thoughtfully designed, and positioned within an established community that values both privacy and accessibility. The 124m² built area sits on a generous 343m² plot, providing the space and seclusion that characterize truly premium properties in this market.\n\nThe Costa Blanca property market is experiencing robust growth (+8% year-on-year), with rental yields demonstrating strong fundamentals. At typical weekly rental rates of €800, this villa offers flexibility for owners seeking to generate income between personal use periods. For the discerning buyer, this represents more than a residence—it's a strategic acquisition in one of Spain's most dynamic property markets.",
  "areaSection": "Polop occupies a distinctive position in the Costa Blanca landscape—elevated inland from the crowded coastal strip yet positioned to access Mediterranean beaches within 20 minutes. This hillside village at approximately 300 meters elevation benefits from a microclimate that moderates summer heat while maintaining the region's celebrated 300+ days of annual sunshine.\n\nThe geography creates a natural buffer against the mass tourism that defines coastal alternatives. Surrounded by pine forests and characterized by winding streets that discourage through-traffic, Polop has maintained authenticity while developing the infrastructure that luxury residents expect. The elevation provides superior views across the coastal plain toward the Mediterranean, creating an aesthetic appeal that transcends typical Spanish property listings.",

Local markets operate alongside modern supermarkets (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum), providing authentic shopping experiences without sacrificing accessibility. Healthcare is comprehensive—regional hospitals with English-speaking physicians are accessible within 30 minutes, supplemented by private clinics for those preferring premium medical services.\n\nThe expat community has created an infrastructure of services and social networks that facilitate integration without requiring cultural compromise. Weekly social gatherings, sports clubs, and professional networks operate seamlessly. Proximity to championship golf courses, Blue Flag beaches, and the cultural offerings of nearby Benidorm provides sufficient variety for even the most demanding lifestyle expectations.",
