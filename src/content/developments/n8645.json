  "areaSection": "Finestrat sits on the northern edge of the Costa Blanca, where the Sierra de Olta mountain range meets crystalline Mediterranean waters. This distinctive geography creates a microclimate that's marginally cooler and less humid than coastal towns further south, with average temperatures of 18°C in winter and 28°C in summer. The town has evolved from a quiet fishing village into a carefully managed residential community, maintaining its architectural character while welcoming international investment. Unlike overdeveloped beach towns, Finestrat has retained its authentic Spanish character, with narrow stone streets, family-run restaurants, and genuine community life alongside modern amenities. The elevation provides natural advantages—cooler temperatures, exceptional air quality, and coastal views that property valuations consistently reward.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Finestrat combines Mediterranean tranquility with sophisticated convenience. The established international community means English is widely spoken, yet authentic Spanish culture remains the neighborhood's backbone. Mornings might include coffee at a local café overlooking the Benidorm skyline, afternoons spent at one of the nearby Blue Flag beaches, and evenings at family-owned restaurants serving fresh Mediterranean cuisine. The weekly markets offer fresh produce, local cheeses, and seafood—a ritual that many residents consider central to the Finestrat lifestyle. Healthcare access is straightforward, with English-speaking doctors available both privately and through Spain's excellent public system. The international school network ensures families have education options without sacrificing community integration. Shopping runs are split between modern supermarkets and traditional markets, preserving that balance between contemporary convenience and authentic living that luxury buyers increasingly seek.",

  "investmentSection": "This property sits within the Costa Blanca's strongest performing market segment. Finestrat has demonstrated consistent capital appreciation of +8% year-on-year over the past five years, outpacing broader regional averages. The combination of limited new construction, strong international demand, and geographic constraints creates natural upward pressure on valuations. Beyond capital growth, the property generates immediate rental income—owners consistently achieve €800 per week during peak season through holiday let platforms, translating to potential annual returns of 5-7% on invested capital. The 3-bedroom configuration appeals to both family holiday-makers and couples seeking extended coastal stays. Compared to properties in the Balearic Islands (Mallorca, Ibiza) trading at €10,500-€15,000/m², or the British market averaging £8,500/m², this villa's €6,599/m² represents exceptional value. The combination of proven capital growth, consistent rental demand, and below-market pricing positions this as an intelligent acquisition for long-term wealth building.",
