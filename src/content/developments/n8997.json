    {
      "question": "How much does this property cost?",
      "answer": "€1,300,000.

    },
    {
      "question": "Is Costa Blanca a good place to buy property?",
      "answer": "Yes, Costa Blanca represents one of Europe's most established international property markets with proven appreciation, stable demand, and comprehensive infrastructure supporting foreign ownership. The region demonstrates consistent 8% year-on-year appreciation with particular strength in value-positioned coastal towns like Los Alcazares where international communities have established robust support networks. Healthcare, education, and legal frameworks are internationally recognized, making property acquisition straightforward for discerning buyers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can foreigners buy property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Yes, non-Spanish citizens can purchase property in Spain without restrictions. You require a Spanish tax identification number (NIE), typically obtainable through your property lawyer. The process is straightforward, with established legal frameworks protecting international buyers. Most property transactions in Los Alcazares involve international purchasers, with English-speaking legal professionals facilitating smooth acquisition processes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the costs of buying property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Purchase costs typically total 8-10% of property price, including 6-7% transfer tax (ITP), legal fees (0.5-1%), notary costs (0.3-0.5%), and registration fees. For €1,300,000 property, anticipate approximately €104,000-€130,000 in acquisition costs. Annual ownership costs include property tax (approximately 0.4-0.75% of fiscal value), community fees (approximately €100-€200 monthly), and utilities. Your legal advisor provides detailed cost breakdowns prior to purchase."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a visa to buy property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Property purchase does not require Spanish residency or visa. Non-residents can acquire properties using your home country's legal status. However, many property buyers subsequently pursue Spanish residency through the \"Investor Visa\" programme (requiring €500,000+ investment) or the \"Golden Visa\" programme. Los Alcazares attracts many non-resident European property owners who visit seasonally without residency requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much are property taxes in Spain?",
      "answer": "Annual property tax (IBI) is calculated on cadastral value—typically 0.4-0.75% of assessed value for residential properties. For a €1,300,000 villa, expect approximately €3,200-€6,000 annually depending on local assessment. Additionally, if you're a non-resident, you pay annual non-resident income tax on imputed rental value (approximately 19% of calculated rental income). Your property advisor provides precise tax estimates based on specific property assessment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get a mortgage in Spain as a foreigner?",
      "answer": "Yes, numerous Spanish and international banks offer mortgages to foreign property buyers. Typical lending covers 60-70% of property value, with competitive rates (currently 3.5-4.5% for 20-year terms). Spanish banks require substantial documentation including income verification and employment confirmation. Many international buyers source funding through their home countries or use savings for acquisition. Mortgage pre-approval prior to property search streamlines the purchasing process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Costa Blanca good for retirees?",
      "answer": "Excellent. Costa Blanca has become Europe's premier retirement destination with established healthcare infrastructure, English-speaking medical professionals, and comprehensive senior services. Los Alcazares specifically offers mild year-round climate, accessible transportation, and international communities where retirees integrate easily. Cost of living is substantially lower than northern Europe (approximately 30-40% below UK costs), whilst maintaining healthcare standards exceeding many European alternatives."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the weather like on Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Exceptional. Los Alcazares enjoys approximately 300 days of annual sunshine with average temperatures of 17°C in winter and 28°C in summer. The Mar Menor's unique geography creates micro-climate advantages—summers remain cooler than Spanish island alternatives (no extreme heat), whilst winters maintain consistent mild temperatures rarely dropping below 10°C. This stability particularly appeals to retirees and buyers seeking reliable Mediterranean climate without extreme seasonal variations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the advantages of buying in Los Alcazares specifically?",
      "answer": "Los Alcazares offers exceptional positioning within Costa Blanca: established international community, authentic Mediterranean character, proven investment appreciation (8% year-on-year), accessible healthcare, premium resort developments like Santa Rosalía, and proximity to Alicante airport without premium-market pricing. Properties command 40-50% discounts versus Spanish island markets whilst maintaining comparable quality standards and investment fundamentals."
