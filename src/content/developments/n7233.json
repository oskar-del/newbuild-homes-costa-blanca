    },
    {
      "question": "What are the costs of buying property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect acquisition costs of 7-10% including transfer tax (6-8%), notary fees (0.5-1%), and legal fees (1-2%). An additional 1-2% covers property registration. Total entry cost for this €125,000 property would be approximately €133,000-€138,000. Ongoing costs include annual property tax (0.4-1.1% of cadastral value), community fees if applicable, and utilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get a mortgage in Spain as a foreigner?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign investors regularly obtain Spanish mortgages. Spanish banks typically offer 50-80% loan-to-value for EU citizens and established residents. Interest rates are competitive (2.5-4% current rates). Non-residents may require larger deposits (30-40%) or seek international mortgage options. This €125,000 property could realistically be financed with €50,000-€62,500 down payment, spreading investment across multiple properties."

The region's combination of appreciating property values and immediate rental income makes it attractive for both residential and investment buyers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the rental income potential for this property?",
      "answer": "This 1-bedroom apartment can generate €800+ per week during peak season (summer months), translating to €3,200+ monthly or €38,400+ annually from 10-month occupancy. Off-peak months support long-term tenancy at €600-€800 monthly. Professional property management is available locally at 15-20% commission, leaving investors with €30,000-€32,000 net annual income—a 24-26% return after management fees."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far is Archena from beaches and tourist attractions?",
      "answer": "Archena is strategically positioned 20 minutes from multiple Blue Flag beaches including Playa del Saladar, close enough for weekend beach days and guest entertainment yet far enough to avoid coastal crowding and premium pricing.

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the climate like in Archena year-round?",
      "answer": "Archena enjoys Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of annual sunshine, mild winters (8-15°C), and warm summers (28-32°C).

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the expected property appreciation in this area?",
      "answer": "Archena is experiencing 8% year-on-year property appreciation, significantly above European averages. This growth is supported by infrastructure investment, increasing tourism appeal, and undervaluation compared to saturated coastal markets. A €125,000 purchase could reasonably reach €180,000-€200,000 within 8-10 years based on regional trends, providing substantial capital appreciation alongside rental income."
