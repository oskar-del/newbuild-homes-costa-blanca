The Centro location places you at the epicentre of this activity, surrounded by independent shops, traditional markets, international restaurants, and local cafés that give the neighbourhood its distinctive character. This isn't a resort atmosphere—it's a real, working community where locals and residents coexist seamlessly.\n\nAt 44 square metres, this efficiently designed studio maximises every inch of space. The compact footprint makes it ideal for first-time buyers, investors seeking rental properties, or those downsizing to a more manageable home without sacrificing location quality.

  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's rental market demonstrates consistent strength, driven by year-round tourism and growing long-term resident populations.

Short-term holiday rental platforms show strong occupancy rates during summer months, while the expanding digital nomad community has created reliable winter demand.\n\nBeyond seasonal tourism, Torrevieja attracts European retirees and remote workers seeking affordable Mediterranean living with genuine urban infrastructure. This dual market—seasonal tourists plus long-term residents—creates stable rental income potential. The newly built status means minimal maintenance concerns during initial ownership years, allowing investors to focus on maximising returns rather than managing renovation projects.",
