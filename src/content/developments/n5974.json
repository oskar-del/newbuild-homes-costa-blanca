  "areaSection": "Algorfa is a charming inland village in southern Alicante, positioned perfectly between the cosmopolitan energy of Torrevieja and the tranquility of the Vega Baja countryside. Nestled just 15 minutes from pristine Mediterranean beaches and surrounded by four championship golf courses, Algorfa has evolved from a quiet agricultural town into a thriving international community. The climate here is Mediterranean gold—330+ days of sunshine annually with mild winters, making it ideal for year-round golf. Unlike overcrowded coastal developments, Algorfa maintains authentic Spanish character while embracing modern expat amenities. The area sits at the heart of the Costa Blanca's most developed golfing infrastructure, with courses like La Finca, Lo Romero, La Marquesa, and Vistabella all within 20 minutes. This geographic sweet spot offers the best of both worlds: direct beach access without beachfront crowds and prices.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Life in Algorfa revolves around a strong international community where golf binds neighbors into genuine friendships. The La Finca Golf resort acts as the social hub—mornings start with coffee at the clubhouse before rounds, lunches stretch into afternoon competitions, and evenings mean proper Spanish dinners in nearby restaurants where English menus are standard. Your daily routine includes access to Mercadona supermarkets in nearby Rojales (10 minutes), local village markets with fresh produce, and major shopping centers in Torrevieja (20 minutes) for everything else. The expat population here speaks your language literally—English is commonly heard, healthcare providers offer English consultations, and social networks are well-established. Weekends mean either challenging yourself on different courses or escaping to Guardamar or La Mata beaches (15-20 minutes). The pace is refreshingly slower than coastal towns: less traffic, lower prices, genuine Spanish hospitality with international comfort.",
