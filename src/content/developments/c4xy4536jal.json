      "question": "Is Costa Blanca a good place to buy property?",
      "answer": "Yes. Costa Blanca demonstrates consistent appreciation (8% year-on-year), established international communities, excellent healthcare and education infrastructure, and strong rental income potential. Northern Costa Blanca, specifically Jalon, offers authentic village character without speculative bubble risk, attracting serious investors and lifestyle-focused buyers seeking long-term stability rather than rapid capital gains."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can foreigners buy property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Yes. EU and non-EU citizens have equal property purchase rights in Spain with minimal restrictions. Buyers require a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and should engage legal representation to navigate documentation, taxes, and registration. The process typically requires 6-8 weeks from offer acceptance to property transfer completion. Our agency facilitates all necessary documentation and coordinates with qualified legal professionals."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the costs of buying property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Property purchase costs typically total 8-10% above purchase price, including: transfer tax (3-5%), legal fees (0.5-1%), notary fees (0.2-0.5%), property registration (0.1-0.2%), and agency commission. Additional costs include mortgage fees (if applicable) and home inspection. Total investment for this €540,000 property would approximate €583,000-€594,000. We provide detailed cost breakdowns during initial consultations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a visa to buy property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Property purchase does not require visa or residency status. However, purchase does trigger non-resident tax obligations and may support residency applications under Spain's investment programs. EU citizens enjoy extended stay rights (180 days annually) without residency. Non-EU citizens should consult immigration specialists regarding long-term residence intentions and available visa categories supporting property ownership."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much are property taxes in Spain?",
      "answer": "Annual property taxes (IBI) average 0.4-0.5% of cadastral value (often lower than market price), approximately €2,160-€2,700 annually for this property. Spanish residents pay income tax on rental income (19-45% depending on earnings level). Non-residents pay non-resident property tax (1.1% of assessed value). Capital gains tax applies to future sale proceeds (19-23% for residents). Professional tax planning is recommended for international buyers."

      "answer": "Yes. Major Spanish banks and international lenders offer mortgages to foreign buyers, typically financing 70-80% of purchase price with interest rates currently 3.5-5%. EU citizens face easier lending processes than non-EU nationals. Applications require proof of income, employment history, and credit verification. Non-residents typically face higher rates and stricter requirements. We coordinate with mortgage specialists familiar with international buyer scenarios."

      "question": "What is the cost of living in Costa Blanca?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Is Costa Blanca good for retirees?",
      "answer": "Excellent.
