  "metaTitle": "Luxury 4 Slaapkamers Villa Orihuela Costa €1.6M | La Zenia",
  "metaDescription": "Exclusief 4-bedroom villa in La Zenia, Orihuela Costa. 350m² premium specification. €1,600,000. 35% less than Costa Blanca Noord.",
  "heroIntro": "This exceptional 4-bedroom villa in La Zenia represents a rare opportunity to acquire premium Mediterranean real estate at a significant value advantage. With 350 square metres of meticulously finished living space set across an exclusive 580-square-metre plot, this property exemplifies the sophisticated coastal lifestyle that discerning international buyers seek. Priced at €1,600,000, this villa commands €4,571 per square metre—a remarkable 35% discount compared to comparable properties in Costa Blanca North, yet maintaining the highest standards of construction and finish. The property features four generously proportioned bedrooms and four full bathrooms, providing the space and privacy expected by those with refined tastes. Positioned in La Zenia, one of Orihuela Costa's most prestigious residential enclaves, this villa combines exclusivity with accessibility to world-class amenities, championship golf courses, and pristine Mediterranean beaches. The substantial plot size ensures privacy and potential for outdoor entertainment spaces that complement the sophisticated interior design.",
  "areaSection": "La Zenia and Orihuela Costa occupy a distinctive position on Spain's southern Costa Blanca, renowned for their elevated standards of residential development and international community. Located approximately 50 kilometres south of Alicante, this region benefits from year-round Mediterranean sunshine and a temperate climate that attracts discerning relocators seeking quality of life. The area has evolved significantly over the past two decades, establishing itself as a premier destination for British, Scandinavian, and Dutch expatriates. The geography features gently rolling hills meeting pristine coastline, offering both elevated sites with views and established neighbourhoods with mature landscaping. Orihuela Costa's development has been characterised by careful planning and architectural standards that distinguish it from more chaotic coastal development elsewhere. The region's investment in infrastructure, schools, healthcare facilities, and recreational amenities reflects a commitment to sustainable, high-quality growth.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Orihuela Costa means embracing a cosmopolitan Mediterranean existence where European sophistication meets Spanish warmth. The expat community here is substantial and well-established, with English widely spoken in shops, restaurants, and professional services—a significant advantage for international residents. Daily life revolves around beach clubs, excellent restaurants ranging from traditional Spanish tavernas to contemporary Mediterranean cuisine, and vibrant weekly markets. Healthcare is exceptional, with multilingual doctors and modern facilities nearby. The calendar is marked by cultural events, international cuisine options, and social opportunities within a welcoming community of like-minded residents. Golf is particularly prominent, with five championship courses within 15 minutes, making it ideal for enthusiasts. The pace of life is relaxed yet cosmopolitan; you might spend your morning at a Blue Flag beach, afternoon at an 18-hole championship course, and evening at a Michelin-standard restaurant. For families, international schools provide British curricula and globally-recognised qualifications. The established infrastructure means minimal adjustment period for those relocating from northern Europe.",
  "investmentSection": "The Costa Blanca property market demonstrates robust fundamentals with year-on-year appreciation of approximately 10%, reflecting sustained international demand and limited premium inventory. This villa's valuation at €4,571 per square metre represents compelling value relative to comparable northern Costa Blanca properties commanding €7,000+ per square metre. Rental potential is particularly attractive for investors seeking income generation; comparable 4-bedroom villas in this location typically achieve €800 per week during peak season, translating to €35,000+ annually from minimal management. La Zenia specifically benefits from strong tourism infrastructure and established vacation rental market dynamics. The property's premium specification supports premium rental rates and appeals to discerning short-term rental clients. Long-term appreciation potential benefits from continued international interest, infrastructure development, and limited new supply in established residential areas. For those seeking exposure to Spanish real estate without northern European price points, this represents an exceptionally well-positioned acquisition.",
  "conclusion": "This exceptional villa in La Zenia represents a rare convergence of investment fundamentals, lifestyle advantages, and value proposition. At €1,600,000, it offers premium Mediterranean living at 35% discount to comparable northern coastal properties, with established rental income potential and strong appreciation trajectory. The location within Orihuela Costa's most prestigious residential enclave, combined with championship golf, pristine beaches, and comprehensive English-speaking infrastructure, positions this acquisition ideally for discerning international buyers. Whether seeking a personal residence, investment property, or sophisticated holiday home, this villa delivers on all expectations.
