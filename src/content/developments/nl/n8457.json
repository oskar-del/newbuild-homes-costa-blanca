The town experiences over 300 days of sunshine annually, with mild winters and warm summers—perfect for year-round holiday escapes. The surrounding countryside showcases typical Costa Blanca landscapes: citrus groves, almond trees, and white-washed villages. Despite rapid growth in international residents, Dolores retains its local Spanish identity, with traditional markets, family-run restaurants, and community events. The area has experienced steady property appreciation (+8% year-on-year), making it increasingly sought after by investors and second-home buyers.",

  "investmentSection": "This property sits at an attractive intersection of value and opportunity.

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Hoeveel kost dit vastgoed?",
      "answer": "€450,000. This 3-bedroom quad house offers premium specification at €4,369/m²—40% less than equivalent properties in Spanish island markets. Payment options including mortgage financing are available; approximately 70% of international buyers obtain financing through Spanish banks offering 70-80% LTV mortgages at competitive rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders vastgoed kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, completely. Foreign nationals have identical property purchase rights as Spanish citizens. No visa required for property purchase. EU citizens enjoy additional protections; non-EU buyers simply require an NIE (tax identification number, easily obtained). Legal procedures are transparent and well-established, with thousands of international buyers purchasing annually on Costa Blanca."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca een goede plek om vastgoed te kopen?",
      "answer": "Excellent. Costa Blanca combines Mediterranean lifestyle, 300+ annual sunshine days, established infrastructure, 8% year-on-year property appreciation, and robust tourist rental demand. The region attracts 10+ million annual visitors, generating consistent holiday rental income. International expat communities ensure English-language support and familiar services. Property values trend upward while remaining accessible compared to other European coastal destinations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van het kopen van vastgoed in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Total acquisition costs typically reach 10-12% beyond purchase price: transfer tax (6-10% depending on region), notary fees (1-2%), registry fees (0.5-1%), and legal fees (1-2%). In this case, expect €45,000-€54,000 in total acquisition costs on €450,000 purchase. Additional annual costs include property tax (approximately €300-500 annually) and community fees (if applicable, typically €50-100/month in urbanizaciones)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan ik als buitenlander een hypotheek krijgen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes. Spanish banks routinely finance foreign buyers, typically offering 70-80% LTV (loan-to-value) mortgages at competitive rates (currently 2.5-4% depending on terms). Interest rates remain below most European countries. EU citizens access easiest financing; non-EU buyers need NIE and proof of income but face no discrimination. Many use UK mortgages against overseas property; Spanish mortgages offer lower rates for Spain-based purchases. This €450,000 property would qualify for approximately €315,000-€360,000 financing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van levensonderhoud aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Significantly lower than Northern Europe. Groceries average 15-20% cheaper than UK; restaurant meals €8-15 for quality dining; utilities €60-100/month; healthcare excellent and affordable. Retirees report comfortable living on €1,200-1,500/month including leisure and dining. Holiday home owners primarily budget for property taxes, utilities, and maintenance (minimal in new builds). Rental income from this property (€20,000-€30,000 annually) substantially offsets ownership costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca geschikt voor gepensioneerden?",
      "answer": "Exceptionally. The region attracts 40,000+ British retirees specifically. Healthcare rivals UK standards with English-speaking doctors abundant. Cost of living suits fixed incomes. Sunshine, beaches, and established expat communities create vibrant retirement lifestyle. Many retire at 55-60 and move here year-round; others maintain UK homes while spending winters here. Visa requirements: non-EU retirees need D-visa (approx €500/year), easily obtained by proving €1,400/month income and health insurance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe ver is de Costa Blanca van Nederland?",
      "answer": "Alicante Airport is 45km away with direct flights to London (London Gatwick, London Luton, Manchester) taking 2.5 hours. Over 50 weekly flights connect Alicante to UK airports, with fares typically €50-120 return in off-peak seasons. Weekend flights are frequent; flying Friday evening and returning Sunday is standard practice for holiday home owners. The region's accessibility makes frequent trips practical and affordable for part-time residents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe is het weer aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Exceptional. Over 300 sunshine days annually with average temperatures 18°C winter (mild, rarely freezing) and 28°C summer (warm, not extreme). Rainfall concentrates September-October; spring and summer remain dry and perfect. Winter is ideal for escaping Northern European weather—crisp, sunny days without harsh conditions. This climate supports outdoor living year-round: beach days December through February remain possible, while summers offer reliable heat. Property owners enjoy spring and autumn as perfect seasons with mild temperatures and lower tourist crowds."
    },
    {
      "question": "What rental income potential does this property offer?",
      "answer": "Substantial. Comparable 3-bedroom properties in Dolores and nearby Costa Blanca generate €800-1,200 per week during summer peak season (June-September) and €500-700 during shoulder seasons (April-May, September-October). Conservative estimates suggest €20,000-€30,000 annual rental income when managed through established platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com, VRBO). Many owner-occupants use this income to subsidize holiday visits, covering utilities, maintenance, and property taxes while enjoying personal use 4-6 weeks yearly."
