    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders vastgoed kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign nationals can freely purchase property in Spain without restrictions or special permits. You'll need a Spanish tax identification number (NIE), but the purchase process is straightforward and transparent. Many UK buyers successfully own Spanish property without residency requirements. Legal procedures are well-established, and English-speaking lawyers specializing in property transactions are readily available throughout the region."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van het kopen van vastgoed in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Purchase costs typically amount to 8-10% beyond the property price, including: transfer tax (6-8% depending on region), notary fees (0.5-1%), property registration fees (0.1%), and legal fees (1-2%). A €238,000 purchase therefore involves approximately €19,000-24,000 in additional costs. These fees are significantly lower than UK stamp duty equivalents, enhancing overall value."

    {
      "question": "Hoeveel bedraagt de onroerendgoedbelasting in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Non-resident property owners pay 19-21% income tax on rental revenue, though legitimate expenses reduce taxable income substantially. Annual property tax (IBI) averages €200-400 for properties this size. Wealth tax applies only to properties exceeding €600,000 value. For €238,000 properties generating €16,000-41,000 annual rental income, tax obligations remain manageable and predictable, with many costs deductible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan ik als buitenlander een hypotheek krijgen in Spanje?",

Typical terms offer 70-80% loan-to-value ratios at competitive interest rates (currently 3.5-4.5%). You'll need documentation including ID, proof of income, and bank references. Spanish mortgages often prove more favorable than refinancing through UK lenders, making €238,000 properties accessible through conventional financing."

Rainfall concentrates in autumn and spring, with summer months remaining reliably dry. This weather consistency makes Cox ideal for year-round holiday access—swimming and outdoor activities prove enjoyable throughout the year, though July-August peak season brings crowds and heat that inland Cox moderates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe ver is de Costa Blanca van Nederland?",
      "answer": "Alicante-Elche Airport, 45 minutes from Cox, offers direct flights to London (2.5 hours), Manchester (3 hours), and Birmingham (3 hours).
