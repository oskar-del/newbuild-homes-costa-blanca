  "areaSection": "Orihuela is a historic town in southern Alicante, positioned perfectly between the Mediterranean coast and inland attractions. With a population of around 37,000, it maintains an authentic Spanish character while welcoming an established international community. The town enjoys over 300 days of sunshine annually, with mild winters (rarely below 10°C) and warm summers tempered by coastal breezes. Geographically, Orihuela sits just 15 minutes from Blue Flag beaches, 45 minutes from Alicante Airport, and within easy reach of championship golf courses. The surrounding region offers remarkable diversity – from sandy beaches to traditional Spanish villages, modern amenities to peaceful countryside. Unlike some overdeveloped coastal areas, Orihuela has maintained its authentic character while providing all necessary services. The cost of living here is significantly lower than northern Europe, stretching retirement income further while maintaining high quality of life standards.",

  "investmentSection": "Beyond personal enjoyment, this property demonstrates solid investment fundamentals. The Costa Blanca property market has appreciated 8% year-on-year, with Orihuela specifically performing well as investors recognize the value proposition compared to oversaturated coastal areas. At €3,147 per square meter, this property commands a premium within Orihuela (where the average is €2,200/m²) due to its superior specification and location within an established golf community – yet remains 40% cheaper than comparable properties in Mallorca or other Spanish island markets. The rental market is active, with typical weekly rentals in similar properties achieving €800, suggesting potential for generating income during months you're not in residence. The gated community setting and established expat infrastructure make this particularly appealing to foreign investors seeking security and ease of management. Property tax in Spain is favorable for EU residents, and the Spanish Golden Visa program offers residency benefits for property investors. Whether you view this as a long-term retirement home, an investment generating rental income, or both, the fundamentals support confidence in this purchase.",
