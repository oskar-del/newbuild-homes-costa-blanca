    },
    {
      "question": "Is Benijofar better than larger Costa Blanca towns?",
      "answer": "Benijofar offers distinct advantages for buyers prioritizing authenticity and genuine community over resort-style bustling.

Property values remain more sustainable, appreciation reflects genuine demand rather than speculative cycles, and daily life maintains neighborhood intimacy. For buyers valuing quality-of-life over nightlife infrastructure, Benijofar delivers superior appeal."
