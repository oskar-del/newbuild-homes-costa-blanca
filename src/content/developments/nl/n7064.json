With a population of around 28,000, it maintains the authenticity of traditional Spanish living while offering all modern conveniences. The climate is Mediterranean—over 300 days of sunshine annually—making it ideal for families who love outdoor activities. The town sits just 20 minutes from pristine Blue Flag beaches and is perfectly positioned for accessing both nature and amenities. San Javier has evolved into a preferred destination for British and Northern European families, offering affordable living costs, excellent healthcare, and strong school options. The local airport at San Javier itself, plus proximity to Alicante International Airport (35 minutes), makes visiting family in the UK straightforward. The surrounding area blends rural charm with modern infrastructure—you'll find supermarkets, restaurants, and services minutes away, yet maintain that peaceful, suburban feel many families crave.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in San Javier centers around family, community, and outdoor enjoyment. Mornings might start with a coffee at a local café where neighbors gather—you'll recognize faces within weeks thanks to the tight-knit international community.

  "investmentSection": "From an investment perspective, this villa presents compelling value. At €4,799/m², you're paying a premium specification price while San Javier's area average sits at €2,200/m²—reflecting this property's superior condition and location. However, market data shows San Javier property values rising 8% year-on-year, suggesting strong appreciation potential. More immediately, the rental market is robust: similar 3-bedroom villas in the area command €800+ per week during holiday seasons (July-August rates reach €1,200). Even conservative estimates—renting 25-30 weeks annually—generate €20,000-24,000 gross rental income. Many owners use this strategy: enjoy the home personally, rent during peak tourist seasons, and let market appreciation build equity. With Spanish property taxes low compared to UK council tax and minimal ongoing maintenance costs, the financial case is strong for both owner-occupiers and investment-focused buyers.",
