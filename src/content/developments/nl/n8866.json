    {
      "question": "Hoeveel kost dit vastgoed?",
      "answer": "€379,900. This three-bedroom villa represents exceptional value, particularly when compared to equivalent properties on Spanish islands which cost 40% more.

    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca een goede plek om vastgoed te kopen?",
      "answer": "Yes, Costa Blanca is an excellent property market for families and investors. The region offers diverse communities, established infrastructure, excellent healthcare and education, and consistent property appreciation (8% year-on-year in this area). Unlike some Spanish markets that depend entirely on tourism, Costa Blanca supports genuine residential communities with international families building permanent lives. Property values remain reasonable compared to northern Europe, and many families find the lifestyle balance justifies the investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders vastgoed kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, non-residents and non-EU citizens can purchase property in Spain without restrictions. The process requires a Spanish tax number (NIE), which is straightforward to obtain. Many property agencies and legal firms specialize in assisting international buyers through every step. You'll need professional legal representation to navigate documentation and complete due diligence, but the process is well-established and secure for international purchasers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van het kopen van vastgoed in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect additional costs approximately 8-13% of the property value. These include transfer tax (6-8% depending on regional location), legal fees (€1,000-3,000), notary fees (€1,000-2,000), property registration (€500-1,500), and surveyor costs if desired. For this €379,900 property, total acquisition costs would range €30,000-50,000 approximately. Monthly ownership costs include property tax (modest, typically €200-400 annually), utilities, and optional community fees if applicable. Your legal representative will provide exact figures specific to your circumstances."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van levensonderhoud aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Cost of living in Fuente Álamo is notably reasonable, particularly for families relocating from northern Europe. Monthly expenses for a family of four typically range €2,000-3,500 depending on lifestyle choices, including rent (if not property owner), utilities, groceries, dining, and activities. Grocery costs are 30-40% lower than UK prices; dining out remains affordable with quality meals available €8-15; utilities cost €150-250 monthly; and activities like beaches and many cultural experiences are free or minimal cost. This affordability advantage increases significantly if your mortgage is completed and paid, as you're only managing ongoing property taxes and maintenance rather than rental costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe ver is de Costa Blanca van Nederland?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is approximately 1,200 kilometers south of the UK, with flight times around 2.5 hours from most UK airports to Alicante-Elche. Regular direct flights from major UK airports make visiting family or quick UK trips straightforward. Many British families maintain connections through occasional travel rather than permanent relocation. The accessibility means you're never far from UK support networks while establishing Mediterranean lifestyle, a significant factor for families considering this move."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe is het weer aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys Mediterranean climate with over 300 sunshine days annually, mild winters, and warm summers. Winter temperatures average 10-15°C daytime (rarely freezing), while summers reach 28-32°C with relatively low humidity compared to other Mediterranean areas. Rainfall is minimal, typically 25-30 days annually, concentrated in autumn and spring. The climate supports outdoor activities year-round, making families appreciate beach access in January and comfortable outdoor dining through most months. Children adapt quickly to this climate, and the consistent sunshine benefits family wellbeing and mood."
    },
    {
      "question": "Heb ik een visum nodig om vastgoed te kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Property purchase does not require a visa in Spain. EU citizens have complete freedom to buy and reside. Non-EU citizens can purchase property as non-residents without visa requirements for the transaction itself. However, if you plan to reside in Spain for extended periods, you may wish to apply for residency (tourist visa conversion to residence visa), which is straightforward for property owners with financial means. Many families purchase property, establish residency, and then relocate at their convenience—the property purchase and residency processes are separate though complementary."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan ik als buitenlander een hypotheek krijgen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, non-resident foreigners can obtain mortgages in Spain, though typically with slightly different terms than residents. Spanish banks require proof of income, financial stability, and usually request 30-40% down payment for non-residents. Interest rates are competitive, typically 3-5% depending on terms and conditions. Many international property purchasers work with specialized brokers who connect them with banks experienced in foreign lending. For this €379,900 property, mortgage options exist ranging from 70% loan-to-value with appropriate documentation. Your legal adviser should include mortgage consultation in their services."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this property a good investment for families?",
      "answer": "This villa combines family lifestyle benefits with genuine investment potential. The 8% year-on-year appreciation trend means equity builds while you enjoy your home. The €379,900 price point represents premium value at 40% less than Spanish island equivalents. Rental potential (€800 weekly achievable) means you can offset costs during periods you're not using it. The established location, proximity to schools and healthcare, and 463m² plot make it ideal for permanent family residence while maintaining investment characteristics. For families seeking both quality of life and financial prudence, this property addresses both objectives simultaneously."
