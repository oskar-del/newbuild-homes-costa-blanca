The Centro location puts you at the pulse of the city, where daily life flows around quality restaurants, independent boutiques, and traditional markets. Unlike resort developments on the outskirts, this penthouse keeps you connected to real community life—morning coffee at local cafés, evening paseos through pedestrianized streets, and genuine neighborhood connections.\n\nThis property exemplifies the appeal of central Torrevieja living: walkable urban infrastructure combined with immediate beach access. Whether you're seeking a permanent residence, a vacation retreat with rental potential, or a smart property investment, this penthouse delivers tangible lifestyle benefits alongside financial sense.",
  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's property market has demonstrated resilience and steady appreciation over the past decade. The town attracts three distinct buyer demographics: Northern European retirees seeking year-round Mediterranean living, Spanish families relocating from inland regions, and international investors seeking rental returns. Centro locations command premium prices precisely because they remain scarce—most development occurs on the periphery.\n\nThis penthouse suits rental investors particularly well. Playa del Cura and the Centro location generate consistent tourism demand across seasons. The proximity to restaurants, shops, and entertainment makes it attractive for holiday rentals and medium-term lets. With Torrevieja establishing itself as a serious alternative to overcrowded Costa del Sol destinations, property values in desirable central locations continue appreciating as the town's infrastructure and reputation improve.",
