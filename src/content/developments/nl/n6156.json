  "metaTitle": "3 Slaapkamers Apartment La Manga €240k - Investment Property",
  "metaDescription": "3-bedroom apartment La Manga del Mar Menor, €240,052. Premium specification, 40% below island markets. High rental demand, 8% annual appreciation.",
  "heroIntro": "This 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in La Manga del Mar Menor represents a compelling investment opportunity in one of Spain's most sought-after coastal markets. Priced at €240,052 (€2,353/m²), this property offers exceptional value—40% less than comparable properties on Spanish island markets—while positioned in a region experiencing consistent 8% year-on-year price appreciation. With 102m² of well-designed living space, this apartment is ideally suited for holiday let investment, commanding typical weekly rental rates of €800 in peak season. La Manga del Mar Menor has established itself as a premier destination for international buyers seeking reliable rental income and capital appreciation. The location benefits from high-volume tourism, year-round climate appeal, and a thriving expat community, making it an attractive acquisition for investors targeting both short-term holiday rental yields and long-term property value growth.",
  "areaSection": "La Manga del Mar Menor is a distinctive coastal enclave in Murcia's southeastern region, famous for its unique geographical position between the Mediterranean Sea and the Mar Menor salt lagoon. This narrow strip of land creates a rare dual-coast environment, offering both open sea beaches and calm lagoon waters. The area enjoys 320 days of annual sunshine with mild winters and warm summers, making it accessible to tourists and residents throughout the year. The Mar Menor is Europe's largest saltwater lagoon and a protected natural space, creating an exclusive environment away from mass tourism. Infrastructure development has been thoughtful, preserving the natural character while providing modern amenities. The region has become increasingly popular with Northern European investors seeking reliable rental returns without the overcrowding associated with major tourist hubs. Towns like Los Alcázares and Santiago de la Ribera provide authentic Spanish atmosphere with international convenience.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Life in La Manga del Mar Menor balances tranquility with accessibility. Daily life revolves around the waterfront—residents enjoy morning walks along Blue Flag beaches, afternoon golf at championship courses, or evening tapas at beachfront restaurants. The established expat community means English is widely spoken, grocery shopping includes familiar supermarket chains (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum), and healthcare providers include English-speaking doctors. Weekly local markets offer fresh produce and regional specialties at authentic prices. The pace is Mediterranean rather than frenetic; many residents describe it as Spain without the tourist chaos. During summer, the influx of holiday visitors creates vibrant nightlife and dining scenes, then quietens to a relaxed rhythm in winter. For investors, this dual-season character is valuable—properties generate rental income in peak months, then provide peaceful retreats during quieter periods. Public transport connects to larger towns, though a car offers flexibility for exploring the broader Costa Blanca region.",
  "investmentSection": "La Manga del Mar Menor's property market is experiencing robust growth, with values appreciating 8% annually—outpacing broader Spanish averages. At €2,353/m², this property sits marginally above the area average (€2,200/m²), offering excellent value given its 40% discount versus comparable Spanish island properties. Holiday let potential is particularly strong: typical weekly rentals reach €800 during peak season (June-September), with shoulder seasons (April-May, October) commanding €500-600. Annual occupancy rates of 60-70% are achievable through professional management, generating €21,000-25,000 annual gross rental income. After maintenance, management fees, and municipal taxes (approximately €4,500 annually), net yields of 8-10% are realistic. Capital appreciation compounds this return—a 5% annual property value increase adds €12,000 to equity annually. The combination of high rental demand, tourism infrastructure investment, and favorable pricing relative to Mediterranean alternatives positions this property for both immediate income generation and long-term wealth accumulation.",
  "conclusion": "This 3-bedroom apartment at €240,052 represents a strategic entry point into La Manga del Mar Menor's investment market. The combination of premium specification, 40% discount versus Spanish island comparables, strong rental demand (€800/week peak season), and 8% annual appreciation creates a compelling investment case. For property investors seeking Mediterranean income generation without the price premium of established coastal hubs, this property delivers both immediate rental revenue and long-term capital appreciation potential. La Manga's year-round climate, international infrastructure, and established expat community remove uncertainty common to emerging property markets—this is proven terrain with consistent demand and transparent economics.
