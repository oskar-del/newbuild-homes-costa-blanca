    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders vastgoed kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, non-EU citizens can legally purchase property in Spain without requiring Spanish residency. British buyers, EU citizens, and most nationalities have equal property rights. You'll need a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and should engage a Spanish lawyer to handle the purchase, ensuring compliance with local regulations and protecting your investment. The process typically takes 4-8 weeks from offer to completion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van het kopen van vastgoed in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price of €492,000, you'll encounter: transfer tax (6-10% depending on region, typically €30,000-€50,000), legal fees (€1,500-€2,500), notary fees (€800-€1,200), and property registration fees (€500-€800). Total acquisition costs typically range 8-12% of the purchase price. These are standard across Spanish property transactions and should be budgeted when planning your purchase."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca een goede plek om vastgoed te kopen?",
      "answer": "Yes, Costa Blanca consistently ranks among Spain's best property investment regions. The area offers excellent value compared to northern Spain, strong year-on-year appreciation (+8% in Pilar de La Horadada), proven rental income potential, established international communities, and genuine beach lifestyle. For families particularly, the combination of affordable prices, quality schools, healthcare, and climate makes it an excellent choice."
    },

      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van levensonderhoud aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca offers significantly lower living costs than northern Europe or Spanish urban centers.

    },
    {
      "question": "Heb ik een visum nodig om vastgoed te kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Property purchase doesn't require visa sponsorship—you can buy as a non-resident investor. However, if you plan extended stays, you may need a Schengen visa or consider residency options. UK citizens can currently visit for 90 days visa-free; for longer stays, options include non-lucrative residency (requiring €27,000 annual income) or digital nomad visas. Consult Spanish immigration authorities for your specific situation, but property ownership itself carries no visa requirements."
    },
    {

      "answer": "De jaarlijkse onroerendgoedbelasting (IBI—impuesto sobre bienes inmuebles) on this villa run approximately €300-€500 yearly, depending on official property valuation. This is remarkably affordable compared to UK council tax. Additionally, residents pay income tax on rental income (21% standard rate) if you let the property. Non-resident owners with Spanish rental income pay 19% tax. These rates are competitive internationally and well-structured to incentivize investment in Spanish property."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan ik als buitenlander een hypotheek krijgen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, multiple Spanish banks offer mortgages to foreign buyers, typically covering 50-80% of purchase price depending on income and credit history. British and EU buyers commonly secure mortgages at competitive rates (currently 3-4%). You'll need proof of income, tax returns, and credit checks. Many families finance purchases with UK mortgages instead, which sometimes offer more favorable terms. A Spanish mortgage advisor can help navigate options and maximize financing efficiency."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca geschikt voor gepensioneerden?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is excellent for retirees—it's consistently ranked among Europe's top retirement destinations. The combination of low cost of living, excellent healthcare, guaranteed sunshine, established expat communities, and beach proximity creates ideal retirement conditions. This property specifically suits active retirees who want space for grandchildren's visits, proximity to beaches for retirement activities, and the investment security of owning property in an appreciating market."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe is het weer aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys 300+ days of sunshine annually with mild, frost-free winters and warm summers. Average temperatures range 8-9°C in winter (January) to 28-30°C in summer (August). Rainfall is minimal, concentrated in autumn and spring.
