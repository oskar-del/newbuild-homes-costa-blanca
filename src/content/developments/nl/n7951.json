Property values appreciate 6-8% annually, rental demand from tourists remains strong, and the cost of living is 25-35% below UK levels.

    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders vastgoed kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners can freely purchase property in Spain without residency requirements. Non-EU citizens require an NIE (Spanish tax identification number), obtained easily through any Spanish consulate. The process is straightforward—most purchases complete within 6-8 weeks. British citizens post-Brexit maintain equal property rights as EU residents. Legal requirements are transparent and regulated by Spanish law."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van het kopen van vastgoed in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Total acquisition costs typically range 8-10% above property price. Expenses include transfer tax (6-7%), notary fees (0.5-1%), registry fees (0.2%), legal fees (0.5-1%), and agent commission (3-5%).

Fuel is approximately 10% cheaper than UK prices. Overall cost of living is 25-35% below UK equivalents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan ik als buitenlander een hypotheek krijgen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers can obtain Spanish mortgages through local banks and international lenders. Most banks offer 70-80% loan-to-value at competitive rates (2-4% currently). You'll require proof of income, employment contract, and NIE number. British expats typically secure mortgages through Santander, BBVA, or specialized lenders. UK mortgage advisors can facilitate cross-border financing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are property taxes in Spain?",
      "answer": "Annual property tax (IBI) averages 0.4-1.1% of registered property value. For a €399,900 property, expect €1,600-4,400 annually depending on municipal rates. Rental income from properties is taxed at 19% national level. Capital gains tax applies when selling (from 19-45% depending on ownership duration). Spanish residents pay 45% income tax on worldwide income. Consult a Spanish tax advisor regarding your specific residency status and obligations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Heb ik een visum nodig om vastgoed te kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "No, property purchase requires no visa. However, if you plan to reside in Spain more than 90 days annually, you'll need residency documentation. Post-Brexit, British citizens can live visa-free for 90 days, then must apply for Spanish residency (usually granted to property owners). Many families obtain Non-Lucrative Visas or Digital Nomad Visas. Property ownership itself doesn't grant residency—separate application is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe ver is de Costa Blanca van Nederland?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is 1,000 miles from London, approximately 2.5 hours by direct flight from most UK airports. Alicante International Airport, 35 minutes from this property, offers daily flights to Manchester, Birmingham, London, and Edinburgh at reasonable fares (€50-120 return). Budget airlines make frequent visiting for family easy and affordable. Many families maintain this property while keeping UK connections."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe is het weer aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys Mediterranean climate with 320 days of annual sunshine and average temperatures of 22°C. Winters are mild (12-15°C) with minimal rainfall. Summers are warm (28-32°C) with low humidity thanks to sea breezes. The Mar Menor's unique geography creates even milder conditions than surrounding areas. Seasonal swimming extends September-May. Weather is ideal for outdoor family activities year-round, though summer requires sun protection."
