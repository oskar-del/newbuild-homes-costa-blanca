  "areaSection": "Altea, nestled on the northern Costa Blanca, commands a distinctive position within Spain's Mediterranean coast. This hillside town rises dramatically from turquoise waters, creating the iconic silhouette of white-washed buildings and the striking blue dome of the church of Nuestra Señora del Consuelo. Altea Hills represents the elevated, exclusive dimension of this area—literally and metaphorically—offering panoramic vistas across the Mediterranean toward Ibiza and the Balearic Islands. The microclimate benefits from warm, dry summers tempered by coastal breezes, and mild winters rarely dropping below 10°C. This geographic position provides accessibility to Valencia and Alicante via modern transport infrastructure, while maintaining the privacy and tranquility characteristic of an elevated residential enclave. The town's elevation naturally creates separation from coastal tourism while remaining minutes from pristine beaches and recreational facilities.",
