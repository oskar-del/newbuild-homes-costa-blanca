  "areaSection": "Guardamar del Segura is a charming coastal town in southern Alicante, located between the vibrant resort of Torrevieja and the quieter beaches of the southern Costa Blanca. This authentic Spanish community has maintained its character while welcoming a growing international population, creating a unique atmosphere that feels more genuinely Spanish than overdeveloped neighboring areas. The town sits along a stunning 10km stretch of Blue Flag beaches, including the popular Playa Centro and the more secluded dune-backed La Roqueta and Les Ortigues beaches. The Mediterranean climate ensures 300+ days of sunshine annually, creating ideal conditions for an active outdoor lifestyle. The area benefits from excellent connectivity—Alicante airport is just 45 minutes away—while remaining peaceful and unhurried. Local amenities are well-developed with supermarkets, restaurants, and services, yet the pace of life remains refreshingly slow.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Guardamar revolves around the beach, community, and enjoying Spain's exceptional climate. Mornings might begin with a stroll along Playa Centro or a coffee at a beachfront café watching the Mediterranean. The Wednesday market brings fresh produce, local crafts, and a genuine slice of Spanish culture. The expat community here—predominantly British and Scandinavian—has created numerous social groups, activities, and cultural events without the artificial feel of larger resort towns. Healthcare is accessible and of high quality, with Hospital de Torrevieja just 15 minutes away and a Centro de Salud in town. Dining ranges from authentic Spanish paella restaurants to international cuisine catering to diverse tastes. The nearby La Marquesa and La Finca golf courses provide leisure opportunities, while Torrevieja (10km away) offers additional shopping and entertainment when desired. Most importantly, Guardamar maintains a relaxed, unhurried pace that makes retirement genuinely enjoyable rather than merely affordable.",
