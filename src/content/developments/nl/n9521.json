This working fishing port town has evolved into a thriving community while maintaining its authentic Spanish character. The geography is spectacular—surrounded by protected beaches, coastal cliffs, and year-round sunshine with average temperatures of 18°C in winter and 28°C in summer. Unlike busier Costa Blanca hotspots, Puerto de Mazarron offers a more relaxed, genuine experience where local traditions blend seamlessly with modern family living. The town benefits from excellent infrastructure—schools, hospitals, supermarkets, and restaurants—all within easy reach. The nearby Mar de Plata development is particularly attractive to families seeking new-build quality with established community amenities. The natural harbor provides protection from wind, making this a preferred location for water sports enthusiasts and those seeking a peaceful coastal lifestyle.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Puerto de Mazarron revolves around family, beach access, and Mediterranean leisure.

The expat community is substantial and welcoming; English is widely spoken in shops, restaurants, and professional services. Weekends are for beaches—multiple Blue Flag beaches are just 15-20 minutes away, perfect for swimming and water activities.

  "investmentSection": "Puerto de Mazarron's property market shows strong fundamentals for family buyers and investors. The area has appreciated 8% year-on-year, driven by increased demand from families seeking affordable Costa Blanca living. At €2,911/m², this villa commands a modest premium over the local €2,200/m² average—justified by modern construction and excellent condition. The rental potential is substantial: typical 7-night holiday lets achieve €800, suggesting annual rental income of €20,000-€24,000 for 26-30 weeks of letting. This makes it attractive as a part-time investment while using it as a family home off-season. Unlike Spanish island markets (Mallorca, Ibiza), where €/m² prices exceed €4,800-€6,000, Puerto de Mazarron offers 40% better value without compromising on climate, beaches, or amenities. The established expat community and infrastructure mean steady demand from buyers and renters. Property prices are unlikely to fall given the area's popularity with British families seeking affordable Mediterranean living within 2 hours of major airports.",

    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders vastgoed kopen in Spanje?",

    },

Getting mortgage approval before making an offer is recommended."
    },
    {

    },

    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe ver is de Costa Blanca van Nederland?",
      "answer": "Direct flight time from UK to Alicante Airport is approximately 2.5 hours from London, 2 hours from Manchester. Puerto de Mazarron is 90 minutes drive from Alicante Airport.
