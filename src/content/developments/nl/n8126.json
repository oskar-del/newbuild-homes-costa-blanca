Net returns after property tax, maintenance, and management typically reach 7-9% annually."

    {
      "question": "Is Los Alcazares good for property investment appreciation?",
      "answer": "Yes, Los Alcazares demonstrates consistent 8% year-on-year appreciation exceeding broader Costa Blanca averages.
