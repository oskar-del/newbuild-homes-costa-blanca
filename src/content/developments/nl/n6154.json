This beautifully appointed 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom town house offers the perfect balance of comfort and affordability—priced at €260,560, it represents exceptional value, 40% less than comparable properties on Spanish islands like Mallorca and Ibiza.

Whether you're seeking a permanent sunshine retreat, a holiday home for family gatherings, or a sound investment in one of Spain's fastest-growing coastal markets, this property delivers. With 97m² of thoughtfully designed living space and premium specifications throughout, every detail has been considered for the discerning buyer who values both lifestyle and investment potential.",
  "areaSection": "La Manga del Mar Menor is a singular destination on the Costa Blanca—a narrow strip of land stretching 22 kilometers between two distinct bodies of water. To the east lies the Mediterranean Sea with its Blue Flag beaches and consistent Atlantic swells; to the west, the tranquil Mar Menor lagoon, Europe's largest saltwater lagoon with warmer, calmer waters perfect for families and water sports enthusiasts. This geographical rarity means two completely different beach experiences within walking distance. The region enjoys over 300 days of sunshine annually, with average temperatures of 18°C in winter and 28°C in summer. The climate supports a relaxed Mediterranean lifestyle year-round, whether you're seeking winter warmth or summer heat. The area has evolved from a quiet fishing village into a thriving international destination while maintaining its authentic Spanish character.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in La Manga del Mar Menor means waking to sea breezes and spending evenings watching sunsets over calm waters. The established expat community—primarily British, German, and Scandinavian residents—has created a welcoming, English-speaking environment where you'll find international friends with shared interests. Daily life balances effortlessly between beach activities, excellent local restaurants serving fresh seafood and traditional Spanish cuisine, and vibrant weekly markets selling local produce. The promenade bustles with cafés, tapas bars, and ice cream shops where locals and visitors mingle naturally. Shopping is convenient with multiple Mercadona and Lidl supermarkets, plus traditional Spanish markets offering fresh fruit, vegetables, and local specialties. Healthcare is excellent with English-speaking doctors readily available and a regional hospital just 30 minutes away. For those with families, international schools offering British curriculum options are nearby, making relocation smooth for households with children.",
  "investmentSection": "La Manga del Mar Menor represents one of Costa Blanca's strongest investment opportunities, with property values rising 8% year-on-year. This 2-bedroom town house at €260,560 (€2,686/m²) sits above the area average of €2,200/m² but commands premium specification that justifies the positioning. The rental market is robust—similar properties achieve approximately €800 per week during peak season (12-14 weeks annually), generating €9,600-€11,200 in summer rental income. Many owners operate mixed models, using their property as a personal holiday home while renting during peak months. The combination of strong tourism demand, limited new development, and an established expat buyer base creates resilient demand. Spanish property benefits from 5-year tax incentives for non-residents, and capital appreciation trends suggest consistent growth aligned with broader Costa Blanca market performance.",
