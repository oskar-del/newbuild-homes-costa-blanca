  "heroIntro": "Welcome to your gateway to the Costa Blanca golf lifestyle. This exceptional 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Algorfa offers the perfect blend of comfort, location, and value—priced at just €206,000 with premium specifications at 50% less than comparable coastal properties. Situated within the coveted La Finca Golf resort community, you're steps away from championship fairways and the vibrant international golfer's paradise that defines modern Costa Blanca living.\n\nAlgorfa has emerged as the smart choice for discerning buyers who refuse to compromise on lifestyle or location.

At €2,452/m², you're investing in premium finish quality while gaining 50% savings versus beachfront alternatives.\n\nThe market data speaks clearly: Algorfa properties have appreciated 12% year-on-year, with rental potential reaching €900 per week. This isn't just a home; it's a smart investment wrapped in a golfer's dream lifestyle. Whether you're planning primary residence, holiday home, or rental investment, this property delivers on all fronts.",
  "areaSection": "Algorfa sits in the heart of the Alicante hinterland, part of the vibrant Vega Baja region where European expats have built a thriving community away from overcrowded coastal strips. The village boasts genuine Spanish character—authentic local markets, family-run restaurants, and tight-knit neighborhoods—while remaining just 15-20 minutes from pristine Mediterranean beaches. The climate here is exceptional: over 320 days of sunshine annually, with mild winters and warm summers ideal for year-round golf. Geographically positioned between the coast and inland towns, Algorfa offers the best of both worlds. The elevation provides relief from summer heat, while proximity to major shopping centers in Torrevieja (20 minutes) and Guardamar beaches ensures you're never isolated. This is where international golfers chose to settle permanently.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Algorfa centers around the golf community and Mediterranean rhythm. Mornings might begin with an early tee time at La Finca Golf, followed by coffee at the clubhouse where you'll inevitably connect with fellow golfers from Germany, UK, Scandinavia, and beyond. The resort community speaks English fluently, making integration seamless. Afternoons could include beach visits to Guardamar (15 minutes) or La Mata (20 minutes), evening meals at local paella restaurants where the catch is daily-fresh, and nights enjoying the cooler temperatures that make outdoor dining so appealing. Shopping is convenient with Mercadona in nearby Rojales, weekly markets in the village, and major centers accessible within 20 minutes. Healthcare access is excellent through the local health center and Hospital de Torrevieja (20 minutes away). The expat golf community here is genuinely welcoming—this isn't tourism, it's where people actually choose to live their best years.",
  "investmentSection": "Algorfa represents one of Costa Blanca's strongest investment opportunities. Year-on-year appreciation of 12% means your €206,000 investment has real growth potential—substantially outpacing inflation and coastal market saturation. Rental income is compelling: similar 3-bedroom properties in the area command €900 per week during peak season, translating to approximately €36,000 annually with strong 50-week occupancy rates among the golf community. Your €2,452/m² cost basis is dramatically lower than beachfront equivalents (50% less), providing built-in equity from day one. The golf resort location ensures consistent tourist demand and high-caliber tenant profiles. Moreover, Algorfa's rising popularity among Northern European retirees—combined with limited new inventory—creates a supply-demand dynamic favoring property values.
