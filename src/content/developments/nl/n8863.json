  "areaSection": "Fuente Álamo is a vibrant residential hub in inland Murcia, strategically positioned between coastal development and rural authenticity. The town benefits from a Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually, moderate temperatures even in summer, and minimal rainfall. Located approximately 25 kilometers from the coast and 45 minutes from Alicante airport, Fuente Álamo offers the best of both worlds: proximity to beaches and urban convenience without premium coastal pricing. The area has undergone significant infrastructure development over the past decade, with modern roads, utilities, and services now established. The established expat community—particularly British residents—has created a welcoming environment where English is widely spoken. Hacienda del Alamo specifically is known for its planned residential design, maintained green spaces, and community facilities.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Fuente Álamo combines practical convenience with relaxed Mediterranean rhythm. The established international community means excellent English language support for healthcare, services, and social activities.

For leisure, multiple Blue Flag beaches are accessible within 20 minutes—perfect for weekend breaks or holiday let guests. Championship golf courses nearby attract active retirees and sports enthusiasts. The community offers restaurants, cafes, and bars with international cuisine alongside authentic Spanish tapas.

  "investmentSection": "Investment fundamentals support strong returns in this Fuente Álamo location. The market is appreciating at +8% annually, outpacing inflation and providing capital growth alongside rental income.

The €196,900 price point at €2,238/m² sits just above the local average (€2,200/m²), representing premium specification at accessible cost. Unlike saturated Spanish coastal markets, inland Murcia offers undervalued entry points with growing recognition as a value destination.
