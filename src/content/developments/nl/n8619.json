    {

    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders vastgoed kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. EU and non-EU citizens can purchase property in Spain without restrictions. You'll need a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and typically a local bank account, but the process is straightforward with professional legal assistance. Most international buyers complete purchases within 6-8 weeks with proper legal representation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van het kopen van vastgoed in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect 6-8% in additional costs: 3% transfer tax (ITP), 1% notary and registry fees, 1-2% legal fees, and optional property inspection (€300-500). On this €379,845 property, total acquisition costs would be approximately €23,000-30,000. Monthly ownership costs (property tax, utilities, insurance) typically run €150-250 depending on amenities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca een goede plek om vastgoed te kopen?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is an excellent property market, particularly for families. The region combines Mediterranean climate (300+ days sunshine annually), established infrastructure, excellent schools, and genuine affordability—especially in emerging areas like Fuente Álamo. Property appreciation averages 5-8% annually, rental demand remains strong, and the established international community facilitates integration for relocating families."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van levensonderhoud aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Cost of living is notably lower than the UK. Groceries, dining out, and utilities cost 30-40% less than UK equivalents. Petrol is affordable, healthcare is inexpensive (especially private services), and property taxes are minimal. A family of four can comfortably live on €2,500-3,500 monthly including rent or mortgage, compared to £3,500-5,000 in equivalent UK areas."
    },

      "answer": "Yes, many Spanish banks offer mortgages to non-residents. Most require 20-30% down payment, proof of income, and Spanish tax identification. Interest rates are competitive (2-3% currently). Working with bilingual mortgage brokers simplifies the process significantly. Many foreign buyers finance 50-70% of purchases, using Spanish mortgages combined with UK equity release or savings."
    },

      "answer": "Exceptional year-round. Costa Blanca enjoys over 300 days of sunshine annually with average temperatures of 18°C in winter and 28°C in summer. Mediterranean climate means mild winters (rarely freezing), warm sunny days, and low rainfall. Spring and autumn are perfect with temperatures around 20-22°C—ideal for outdoor activities and beach time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there international schools near this property?",
      "answer": "Yes, several quality international schools operate 6-12 kilometers from this villa. Most offer British curriculum, International Baccalaureate, or Spanish national qualifications.

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the rental potential for this property?",
      "answer": "Strong. Similar 3-bedroom villas in Fuente Álamo command approximately €800 per week during peak season (June-September), generating €32,000-40,000 annually with 25-30 weeks booked. Off-season rates of €400-500/week during shoulder months extend earning potential throughout the year. Many owners combine personal use with rental income, effectively offsetting ownership costs."
