Legal costs are reasonable, typically 8-10% of purchase price including notary, registry, and taxes.

Lenders require proof of income, bank statements, and appraisal documentation—English-language support is standard. Pre-approval takes 1-2 weeks. Non-residents pay slightly higher rates than residents, but terms remain favorable. Many international buyers work with mortgage brokers specializing in Spanish lending who expedite approval.

    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe ver is de Costa Blanca van Nederland?",
