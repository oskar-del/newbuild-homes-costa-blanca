  "metaDescription": "€410,000 apartment Pilar de La Horadada. 2 bed, 70m². Premium spec, 40% less than islands. Strong rental income potential. 11 images.",
  "heroIntro": "This 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom apartment in Mil Palmeras represents a compelling investment opportunity on the Costa Blanca. Priced at €410,000 (€5,857/m²), it offers premium specifications at 40% less than comparable Spanish island markets—a significant value advantage for savvy investors. The property sits in an established coastal community where €800-per-week rental income is achievable, making it ideal for holiday let portfolios. With Costa Blanca experiencing consistent 8% year-on-year appreciation, this acquisition positions you to benefit from both immediate rental yields and long-term capital growth.

  "areaSection": "Pilar de La Horadada sits on the southern Costa Blanca, approximately 50km south of Alicante airport. This coastal town has evolved into a mature property market characterized by stable prices and consistent rental demand. The Mediterranean climate delivers 300+ days of sunshine annually, with mild winters (average 12°C) and warm summers (28°C). The town balances tourism appeal with residential authenticity—neither overdeveloped like Benidorm nor remote like inland villages. The beachfront location provides direct access to multiple Blue Flag beaches, while the town centre maintains working markets and local restaurants alongside international amenities. Geography favors the investor: close enough to Alicante for airport access and services, yet far enough south to retain character and affordability. The surrounding region offers championship golf courses, water sports facilities, and a protected natural park nearby. This positioning—accessible yet established—explains why Pilar de La Horadada maintains a robust rental market year-round.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Pilar de La Horadada balances beach convenience with practical infrastructure. Mornings begin with Mediterranean beach access; the town's multiple Blue Flag beaches are within a 15-minute walk. The expat community is substantial and English-speaking—you'll encounter British, Nordic, and German residents integrated throughout the town. Shopping is straightforward: Mercadona and Lidl supermarkets handle daily needs, while Tuesday and Saturday markets offer fresh produce and local goods. Healthcare is reliable with a regional hospital 30 minutes away and several private clinics staffed with English-speaking doctors. Restaurants range from fish-and-chip shops catering to British visitors to authentic Spanish paella establishments. Public transport connects to nearby towns, though most residents use cars for flexibility. The social calendar includes golf clubs, beach clubs, and established expatriate social groups. This isn't resort-style tourism—it's a functioning residential community where you can live comfortably, access high-quality services, and tap into a ready market of holiday renters seeking authentic coastal living.",
  "investmentSection": "The investment case rests on three pillars: acquisition value, rental income, and appreciation. At €5,857/m², you're purchasing at 40% discount versus Spanish island properties (Mallorca, Ibiza, Canary Islands command €9,000-12,000/m²). Rental potential is concrete: comparable 2-bedroom apartments in Pilar de La Horadada achieve €800-900 per week in peak season and €500-600 off-season, producing annualized income of €30,000-35,000. That yields approximately 7-8.5% gross return on your €410,000 investment—competitive in European real estate. Costa Blanca has appreciated 8% year-on-year consistently; over five years, your €410,000 investment could appreciate to €602,000 in capital value alone, before accounting for accumulated rental income. Market demand remains robust: 2-million holiday visitors annually visit the Costa Blanca, and Pilar de La Horadada's established infrastructure supports high occupancy rates. This isn't speculative—it's data-driven investment in a proven, mature coastal market.",
  "conclusion": "This 2-bedroom apartment at €410,000 represents a quantifiable investment opportunity, not a speculative purchase. You're acquiring premium specifications at 40% below island-market pricing, positioning yourself to capture 7-8.5% gross rental yields while benefiting from documented 8% annual capital appreciation. The property's turnkey condition eliminates renovation risk. Pilar de La Horadada's established infrastructure—healthcare, services, international amenities—supports both absentee ownership and part-time residency. With direct airport access and proven holiday rental demand, this apartment addresses a genuine market gap: affordable, income-generating coastal property in a stable, mature destination. Whether you're building a rental portfolio, seeking diversification beyond home-market property, or planning coastal residency with income supplementation, this property delivers measurable returns backed by market data, not developer promises.
