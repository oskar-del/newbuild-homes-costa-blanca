    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders vastgoed kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Non-EU citizens can purchase property in Spain without restrictions, while EU citizens enjoy complete freedom. You'll need a Spanish Tax Identification Number (NIE), which is straightforward to obtain. Many international buyers successfully purchase properties through Spanish lawyers and property agents familiar with expatriate transactions. The process is transparent and well-established with thousands of international owners across Costa Blanca."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van het kopen van vastgoed in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect 10-12% in additional costs including property transfer tax (6-8%), legal fees (approximately 0.5%), agency fees (typically 3-5%), and notary/registry costs. Mortgage-related expenses add another 1-2% if financing. Annual costs include local property tax (IBI, typically 0.4-0.6% of property value), community fees if applicable (not applicable here), and utilities. These costs are straightforward and well-documented through your Spanish lawyer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca een goede plek om vastgoed te kopen?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is one of Spain's strongest property markets with consistent international demand, established expat communities, and proven rental potential. The region offers excellent climate, beaches, healthcare access, and diverse accommodation options across price points. Properties appreciate steadily (8% year-on-year in Aguilas), making it both a lifestyle purchase and sensible investment.

    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe is het weer aan de Costa Blanca?",

Summers are warm (28-32°C) with very little rainfall, while winters remain mild (12-17°C)—you'll rarely experience frost or snow.

    },
    {
      "question": "Hoeveel bedraagt de onroerendgoedbelasting in Spanje?",

Annual property tax (IBI) typically runs 0.4-0.6% of the cadastral value (often lower than market value), meaning roughly €120-180 annually on a €297,000 property. Wealth tax applies only to properties exceeding approximately €600,000 in total assets. Capital gains tax applies if you sell at profit, but primary residence exemptions exist for EU residents. These taxes remain favorable compared to property taxes in many countries."

Major banks including Santander, BBVA, and CaixaBank have international departments experienced with expatriate financing. Generally you'll need proof of income, existing property equity, and employment verification. EU citizens often find easier terms than non-EU purchasers. Working with a local Spanish lawyer helps navigate mortgage requirements and ensures your interests are protected."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van levensonderhoud aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Aguilas offers excellent value for living costs compared to northern Europe or major Spanish cities. Groceries cost roughly 20-30% less than UK supermarkets due to local markets and Spanish pricing. Restaurant meals range from €8-12 for casual dining to €25-40 for fine establishments. Utilities are moderate, particularly if you use the abundant sunshine efficiently. Healthcare through public system is excellent and affordable. Leisure activities—beaches, walking, markets—are essentially free, making overall living costs very reasonable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca geschikt voor gepensioneerden?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Costa Blanca has become one of Europe's leading retirement destinations with established healthcare systems, affordable living costs, exceptional climate, and thriving expat communities. Healthcare access meets international standards with English-speaking doctors. Property and living costs remain reasonable, particularly outside peak tourist areas. The combination of Mediterranean lifestyle, social opportunities, and practical amenities makes it ideal for active retirees. Many choose properties like this penthouse specifically for retirement living."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe ver is de Costa Blanca van Nederland?",
      "answer": "Alicante Airport, serving Costa Blanca, is approximately 2.5 hours by direct flight from UK airports including London, Manchester, and Birmingham. Low-cost carriers operate frequent routes, making flights affordable (often £40-80 return).
