    {
      "question": "Hoeveel kost dit vastgoed?",
      "answer": "€392,000. This 3-bedroom villa in San Fulgencio represents excellent value, particularly for families. The price includes a modern, turnkey home in an established community with excellent schools nearby. Payment options typically include mortgage financing (available to foreigners in Spain), or cash purchase. Most buyers arrange Spanish mortgages with competitive rates, typically 3-4%, with many lenders offering 20-25 year terms."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca een goede plek om vastgoed te kopen?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Costa Blanca has seen consistent 8% year-on-year property appreciation, with San Fulgencio performing particularly well. The region attracts families for its climate (300+ days of sunshine), established international communities, excellent healthcare, and quality schools. Property values benefit from steady demand from UK and Northern European buyers, plus a strong summer rental market. Compared to other Spanish regions, Costa Blanca offers proven appreciation and liquidity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders vastgoed kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, completely. Foreigners have equal rights to Spanish citizens when purchasing property. You'll need an NIE (Número de Identidad de Extranjero) number, a Spanish tax identification number easily obtained through your lawyer. No residency permit is required simply to own property. Most UK families use Spanish solicitors to handle paperwork—it's straightforward and costs typically €2,000-3,000 in legal fees. The entire purchase process takes 4-6 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van het kopen van vastgoed in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Beyond the property price, expect: 6-8% transfer tax, 1-2% notary and registration fees, and 1-2% legal fees—typically €25,000-40,000 total for a €392,000 property. Mortgage arrangements cost 0.6% of loan value. Annual costs include property tax (usually €200-400), community fees if applicable, and utilities. Compared to UK stamp duty, Spanish purchase costs are competitive. Your solicitor provides detailed cost breakdowns before purchase."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van levensonderhoud aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Cost of living is remarkably affordable—typically 30-40% less than the UK. Groceries, particularly fresh produce from markets, are inexpensive. Restaurant meals cost €12-18 for lunch, €20-30 for dinner. Utilities are modest (€80-120 monthly). Healthcare and education, particularly private options, cost significantly less than UK equivalents. Families often find their quality of life improves substantially while expenses decrease—a significant benefit for retirees and remote workers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Heb ik een visum nodig om vastgoed te kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically to purchase property. However, UK citizens post-Brexit need a standard entry visa for stays over 90 days, or can apply for long-stay residency visas (D visas) if planning to live permanently. Many property owners use the Golden Visa program (requiring €500,000+ investment), though not necessary for standard home purchases. Your solicitor advises on visa requirements based on your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoeveel bedraagt de onroerendgoedbelasting in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Annual property tax (IBI) is typically 0.4-1.1% of cadastral value (usually lower than market value), so expect €150-400 annually for this property. Transfer tax at purchase is 6-8% of purchase price. Community fees (if applicable) are monthly charges for shared facilities—typically €30-50. These costs are transparent and calculated by your solicitor before purchase. Spain's ongoing property taxes are lower than UK council tax for equivalent properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan ik als buitenlander een hypotheek krijgen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes. Spanish banks readily offer mortgages to foreign buyers. Terms typically include 20-25 year periods with interest rates 3-4% (competitive with UK). You'll need €50,000+ deposit (typically 20-25%), proof of income, and a Spanish NIE number. The process takes 3-4 weeks. Many UK expats maintain mortgages with British banks for remortgaging flexibility. Spanish mortgages are straightforward for employed and self-employed buyers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe is het weer aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Exceptional. Costa Blanca enjoys over 300 days of annual sunshine with average temperatures: summer 28-32°C (82-90°F), winter 12-16°C (54-61°F). Rainfall is minimal (200-300mm annually), concentrated in autumn and spring. This Mediterranean climate is ideal for families—outdoor activities year-round, minimal cold-weather illness, natural vitamin D production. Many families report dramatic health improvements after relocation, particularly for children's respiratory health and parents' joint conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe ver is de Costa Blanca van Nederland?",
      "answer": "Alicante-Elche airport is 45 minutes from this property, with multiple daily flights to UK airports. Flight times average 2-2.5 hours, making weekend visits home practical and affordable. Budget airlines (Ryanair, easyJet) offer competitive fares, often €50-100 return. Many families maintain UK connections while enjoying Spanish lifestyle—visiting home for holidays while children benefit from Mediterranean education and climate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is San Fulgencio a good place for families?",
      "answer": "Excellent. San Fulgencio combines authentic Spanish atmosphere with strong international community—you're not isolated in an expat bubble, but English is widely spoken and support networks exist. The town is safe, with friendly locals and established family networks. Schools include international options with British curriculum. Beaches are 20 minutes away, golf courses nearby, and cost of living is remarkably affordable. The slower pace suits families seeking work-life balance—you'll have time for children and community."
