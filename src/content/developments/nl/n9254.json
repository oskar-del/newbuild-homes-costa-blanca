      "answer": "La Manga's unique geography—a 22-kilometre sandbar separating Mediterranean Sea from Europe's largest lagoon (Mar Menor)—creates extraordinary conditions. Calm protected waters, 300+ annual sunshine days, and a sophisticated international community distinguish it from mass-tourism Costa Blanca destinations.
