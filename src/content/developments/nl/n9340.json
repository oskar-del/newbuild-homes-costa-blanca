  "metaTitle": "3-Bed Apartment Finestrat €499,500 | Investment Property",
  "metaDescription": "Premium 3-bedroom apartment Finestrat, €499,500. 40% less than island markets. Strong rental yield potential. 18 photos, full details.",
  "heroIntro": "This 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Campana Garden represents a compelling investment opportunity on the Costa Blanca. Priced at €499,500—significantly below comparable island markets—the property offers premium specifications at exceptional value. With the Costa Blanca market appreciating at 8% year-on-year, combined with consistent holiday let demand averaging €800 per week, this Finestrat apartment addresses the core investment thesis: capital appreciation plus immediate rental income. The 103m² living space across a 252m² plot provides flexibility for owner-occupancy or full rental management. Located in Finestrat, a town experiencing sustained property demand from both European buyers and holiday lettings, this property positions you to capture both the short-term income stream and long-term appreciation potential. The established infrastructure, proximity to Benidorm's tourism economy, and growing international community make this a strategically sound acquisition in a market where supply remains constrained and demand remains high.",
  "areaSection": "Finestrat is a coastal municipality on the Costa Blanca, situated between Benidorm and Altea. The town offers authentic Mediterranean character while benefiting from proximity to major tourism infrastructure. The landscape features a mix of coastal developments and traditional Spanish neighborhoods, with the Sierra de Ponoig mountains creating a dramatic backdrop. The climate is Mediterranean, with over 300 days of sunshine annually and mild winters—ideal for year-round occupancy or holiday lettings. Finestrat's position on the coast provides direct beach access while remaining quieter than Benidorm, making it attractive to both leisure and investment buyers. The municipality has developed modern infrastructure to support growing residential demand, including improved road networks and utility systems. Local governance actively supports property investment, and English is widely spoken throughout the business and service sectors.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Finestrat centers around beach proximity, outdoor living, and a well-established international community. The town offers quality restaurants featuring both Mediterranean and international cuisine, weekly street markets for fresh produce, and multiple supermarket chains including Mercadona and Lidl. Healthcare access is straightforward—private English-speaking clinics operate locally, with larger hospitals accessible within 30 minutes. The expat community is substantial, with English spoken in most commercial settings, reducing the typical relocation friction. Golf enthusiasts have access to several championship courses within 15-20 minutes. Blue Flag beaches are within walking distance or a short drive, providing recreational value and supporting holiday rental appeal. Public transport via bus connects to neighboring towns, though most residents maintain vehicles for mobility flexibility. The cumulative lifestyle proposition attracts repeating holiday visitors and permanent residents—two demographics essential to sustaining rental income.",
  "investmentSection": "The Costa Blanca property market has demonstrated consistent growth, with values appreciating 8% year-on-year. This apartment at €4,850/m² compares favorably against Finestrat's area average of €2,200/m²—a premium pricing reflecting modern specifications and community amenities. However, the property costs approximately 40% less than comparable units in established Spanish island markets (Mallorca, Menorca), offering superior value. Holiday let income potential is immediate: comparable 3-bedroom units in Finestrat achieve €800 per week during peak season (€41,600 annually), with achievable 38-45 weeks of bookings yielding €31,200-€37,400 annual rental income. This generates 6.2-7.5% gross rental yield on the purchase price. Capital appreciation combined with consistent rental flow creates a two-pronged return profile appealing to investors seeking both income and asset growth. The market fundamentals—supply constraints, increasing European demand, and Benidorm's established tourism infrastructure—support continued appreciation.",
  "conclusion": "This apartment represents a strategically positioned investment combining immediate rental income with long-term capital appreciation. The €499,500 price point—40% below island market comparables—provides entry-level access to established Mediterranean real estate. Market fundamentals support continued appreciation, while proven holiday let demand (€800/week) generates reliable income supporting mortgage payments. For investors evaluating property acquisitions across European destinations, this Finestrat apartment offers superior value, established infrastructure, and dual-income characteristics. The process is transparent: English-speaking legal support, established property management services, and proven buyer infrastructure reduce acquisition friction. Take the next step by contacting our team via WhatsApp for detailed financial analysis, property management projections, and viewing arrangements. We assist investors worldwide through every acquisition phase—from initial evaluation through rental management launch.",
