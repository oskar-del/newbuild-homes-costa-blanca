With Airbnb and professional property management companies active throughout Torrevieja, achieving 50-60% annual occupancy is realistic for well-maintained beachfront properties.

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is this penthouse suitable for year-round living or primarily for holidays?",
      "answer": "The property works exceptionally well for both. The beachfront location and established neighbourhood infrastructure make it genuinely liveable year-round, with excellent healthcare facilities, shopping, and restaurants nearby. However, its rental potential means you can also generate income during periods when you're not occupying it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the actual distance to the beach and how accessible is it?",
      "answer": "The property is precisely 60 metres from El Acequión Beach's entrance—roughly a 60-second walk. The beachfront is accessible 24/7 with direct pedestrian access, and the beach maintains excellent facilities including chiringuitos (beach bars), showers, and lifeguard supervision during summer months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any restrictions on short-term rentals in this area?",
      "answer": "Torrevieja permits short-term rentals through tourist licences, though regulations have tightened slightly in recent years. The majority of beachfront properties successfully operate holiday rental businesses. We recommend confirming current local regulations before purchase, and many property management companies handle licensing requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What parking arrangements exist, and are they mandatory?",
      "answer": "The building offers optional underground parking spaces available at additional cost. Street parking is also available in the surrounding neighbourhood, though beachfront areas can fill during peak season. The close proximity to the beach means many residents use cars minimally, preferring to walk for daily needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the terrace on a penthouse differ from balconies on lower floors?",
      "answer": "This penthouse's private terrace offers exclusive outdoor space without neighbours above or below, significantly increasing privacy and useable area. Penthouses typically capture better breezes and light, and the terrace space here is large enough for dining furniture and entertaining—a premium feature on small Mediterranean properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the community atmosphere like in this 23-unit residential complex?",
      "answer": "The modest size of 23 homes creates an intimate community feel while remaining large enough to justify professional maintenance staff and security. You'll have genuine neighbours rather than being part of a sprawling complex, but with shared amenities and managed maintenance reducing individual property upkeep burdens."
