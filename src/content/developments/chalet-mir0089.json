    "investmentSection": "The Jávea property market has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth, with luxury villas in prime locations like Monte Olimpo showing consistent appreciation over the past decade. Properties in this exclusive area typically yield annual rental returns of 4-6%, with peak season weekly rates for luxury villas reaching €3,000-€4,500, making Chalet MIR0089 an attractive proposition for both lifestyle and investment buyers. The combination of limited supply in premium locations, increasing international demand, and Jávea's growing reputation as a year-round destination creates strong fundamentals for long-term capital appreciation.\n\nThe Spanish government's Golden Visa programme, which grants residency to property investors spending over €500,000, has significantly boosted demand from international buyers, particularly from the UK, Germany, and Scandinavia. Jávea's exceptional infrastructure, healthcare facilities, and established international community make it particularly attractive to high-net-worth individuals seeking a permanent or secondary residence. With new construction in prime elevated positions becoming increasingly rare due to planning restrictions, properties like Villa Claudia represent a finite opportunity to secure a trophy asset in one of the Mediterranean's most desirable locations.",
