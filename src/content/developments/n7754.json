    },
    {
      "question": "What are the costs of buying property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect approximately 8-10% in additional costs: notary fees (0.5-1%), property registration (0.5-1%), lawyer fees (0.5-1%), and property transfer tax (6-7% depending on region). Land registry searches, surveys, and inspections add €500-1,500. These costs are transparent and predictable. Ongoing costs include local property tax (approximately €200-400 annually), utility charges, and insurance—all substantially lower than UK equivalents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I get a mortgage in Spain as a foreigner?",

Required documentation includes proof of income, bank statements, and credit history. Many lenders specialize in expatriate mortgages with English-language support. A €332,000 property would typically allow €232,000-265,000 mortgage with 20-30% down payment required."

The region balances growth markets near the coast with more affordable inland areas like Pinoso that offer genuine Spanish living without tourist premium pricing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the cost of living in Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Daily living costs run 25-35% lower than UK or northern Europe. Grocery shopping at Mercadona costs roughly €200-250 monthly per person. Eating out averages €12-18 for quality meals, electricity €40-60 monthly (seasonal variation), and healthcare through private insurance costs €100-200 monthly.

      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys a Mediterranean climate with 300+ days of sunshine annually. Temperatures average 18°C in winter (rarely freezing) and 28°C in summer. Pinoso, being inland, experiences slightly less rainfall and more moderate heat than coastal areas. Families appreciate the consistent, mild winters and abundant sunshine. Summers are hot (July-August average 30°C+) but manageable with proximity to beaches and air conditioning. Overall, the weather supports year-round outdoor activities and Mediterranean living."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is this villa 40% cheaper than island properties?",
      "answer": "Island markets like Mallorca and Ibiza command premium pricing due to limited land availability, international tourism demand, and perceived exclusivity. This Pinoso villa offers identical construction quality and specifications at mainland prices. You receive the same materials, finishes, and functionality without paying for island branding. The trade-off is being 20 minutes inland rather than beachfront—yet still 20 minutes from excellent beaches, which many families prefer for its quieter, more authentic Spanish community."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the rental income potential for this property?",
      "answer": "Similar 3-bedroom villas in the Pinoso region generate approximately €800 per week in holiday lettings, or roughly €41,600 annually at 52-week occupancy. Most owners target 26-36 week seasonal rental (€20,800-29,600 annually), maintaining personal use and avoiding professional rental taxation complexity. Conservative estimates suggest 4-5% annual rental yields, providing supplemental income while retaining full personal use flexibility. Professional management companies handle bookings and maintenance."
