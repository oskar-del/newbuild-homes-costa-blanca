  "metaDescription": "Buy 2-bedroom apartment in Villajoyosa for €369,000. Premium specification, 40% below island markets. Strong rental yield potential. Costa Blanca investment property.",
  "heroIntro": "This 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Cala de Finestrat represents a compelling investment opportunity in one of Costa Blanca's most sought-after locations. Priced at €369,000 (€4,556/m²), this property offers premium specification at 40% below comparable Spanish island markets, providing exceptional value for investors seeking capital appreciation and rental income. The property sits in a market experiencing consistent +8% year-on-year growth, with typical holiday let returns of €800 per week. For investment-focused buyers, the numbers are particularly attractive: you're acquiring a modern, well-finished apartment in a high-demand tourist destination at significantly better value than Mallorca, Ibiza, or similar markets. The 81m² built space includes two full bathrooms, essential for maximizing short-term rental appeal. Villajoyosa's established infrastructure, international community, and year-round visitor appeal make this a strategic acquisition for both capital growth and consistent rental income generation.",
  "areaSection": "Villajoyosa, known locally as La Vila Joiosa, is a historic coastal town on the Costa Blanca's northern stretch. The town sits between Benidorm and Altea, offering Mediterranean charm without the overdevelopment of larger resorts. Cala de Finestrat represents the quieter, more upscale segment of the broader Villajoyosa area, positioned away from the main tourist corridor but within convenient access to all amenities. The region benefits from a stable, predictable Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually, making it reliably appealing for holiday lettings year-round. The area has undergone selective modernization while retaining character—a balance that appeals to both tourists and permanent residents. Geography places Villajoyosa just 30 minutes from Alicante International Airport, crucial for accessibility.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Villajoyosa combines Spanish authenticity with international convenience. The town hosts an established expat community where English is widely spoken, particularly in commercial and professional services. Cala de Finestrat offers proximity to multiple Blue Flag beaches within 20 minutes, several championship golf courses, and a thriving restaurant scene ranging from Spanish tapas bars to international dining. The town's weekly markets provide fresh local produce at competitive prices, while major supermarket chains (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum) serve everyday needs. Healthcare is accessible via regional hospitals and private English-speaking clinics within 30 minutes. For investors considering this a lifestyle addition to their portfolio, the area offers genuine quality-of-life advantages beyond rental returns—good restaurants, accessible healthcare, excellent beaches, and an established international community.",
  "investmentSection": "The investment fundamentals are robust. Villajoyosa property values have appreciated 8% year-on-year, outpacing broader Costa Blanca averages. At €4,556/m², this apartment trades at a 40% discount to equivalent properties in Mallorca or Ibiza—markets with similar tourist demand and seasonal patterns. Holiday let rental data indicates typical weekly rates of €800 for comparable 2-bedroom apartments, suggesting annual gross rental income potential of €32,000-€35,000 at conservative 40-45 weeks occupancy (accounting for owner use or maintenance). Capital appreciation potential remains strong given consistent tourist arrivals, limited new construction, and the property's position in a higher-specification segment. The combination of reliable rental income, favorable pricing relative to competing island markets, and appreciation trajectory makes this a strategically positioned investment.",
  "conclusion": "This 2-bedroom apartment at €369,000 represents a strategically positioned investment combining immediate rental income potential with long-term capital appreciation. The premium specification, dual bathrooms, modern finishes, and Cala de Finestrat location justify positioning above Villajoyosa's average pricing while remaining 40% below comparable Spanish island markets. For investors analyzing numbers—€32,000-€35,000 annual rental income potential, consistent 8% market appreciation, and attractive acquisition cost—the opportunity warrants serious consideration. The established infrastructure, English-speaking community, accessible healthcare, and proven tourist demand eliminate typical investment complications. We're available for detailed financial modeling, property viewings via video tour or in-person inspection, and complete acquisition guidance.

This property's premium specification at €4,556/m² represents calculated positioning above standard market, justified by rental premium potential."
