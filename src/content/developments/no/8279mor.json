  "areaSection": "Moraira occupies a unique position on the Costa Blanca, positioned between the bustling commercial centers and the quieter inland villages. This charming coastal municipality sits on the northern edge of the province, blessed with a Mediterranean microclimate that delivers mild winters and warm, sun-drenched summers tempered by sea breezes. The landscape is characterized by dramatic escarpments, hidden coves, and pristine beaches that have remained relatively unspoiled compared to other Costa Blanca destinations. The region's geography—with the Peñón de Ifach mountain providing a distinctive landmark—creates natural protection and a sense of enclosure that many international residents find deeply appealing. La Sabatera specifically represents Moraira's most elevated residential area, offering refuge from coastal commercialism while maintaining convenient proximity to beaches and amenities. The area's development has been carefully managed, preserving the village character while welcoming international residents who value quality of life.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Moraira means embracing a refined Mediterranean rhythm that balances accessibility with authentic tranquility. The community attracts a sophisticated international demographic—predominantly British, German, and Dutch professionals and retirees—creating an upmarket, cultured atmosphere rather than the mass-tourism environment found elsewhere on the coast. Daily life centers around unhurried rituals: morning coffee at waterfront cafés overlooking El Portet beach, leisurely Friday market visits, and evening aperitivos with sea views. The restaurant scene ranges from traditional Spanish tavernas serving fresh catch to contemporary establishments catering to international palates. Healthcare facilities are excellent, with both private English-speaking practitioners and public centers ensuring peace of mind. The nearby Lady Elizabeth School serves families prioritizing English-language education, while the quieter, more selective nature of the community attracts those seeking substance over spectacle. Golf enthusiasts enjoy immediate access to Club de Golf Ifach and La Sella Golf Club. This is a place where residents genuinely know their neighbors and where daily life unfolds at a measured, deeply satisfying pace.",
