      "answer": "€469,900. This 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom villa offers premium specification at 40% less than comparable properties on Spanish islands. Payment flexibility is available through Spanish mortgage options, and many foreign buyers secure financing through UK lenders at competitive rates.

    },
    {
      "question": "Er Costa Blanca et godt sted å kjøpe eiendom?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely—especially for families. Costa Blanca combines Mediterranean lifestyle, excellent healthcare, international schools, and year-on-year appreciation (8% currently) with authenticity that mass-tourism zones lack. The region offers genuine value, established expat communities, and diverse property options at all price points. Baños y Mendigo specifically provides family-friendly living without the overcrowding of beachfront towns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlendinger kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners have equal rights to buy property in Spain as Spanish citizens. No residency requirement exists, no ownership restrictions apply to most areas, and foreign nationals can own land indefinitely. The legal process requires a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and typically involves a notary. Most purchases complete within 6-8 weeks. British, American, German, and other nationality buyers routinely purchase throughout Spain without complications."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hva koster det å kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect additional costs: property transfer tax (6-10% depending on region), notary fees (€800-2,000 typically), property registry fees (€300-600), and legal representation (€1,500-3,000 optional but recommended). In Murcia, total acquisition costs typically reach 8-10% above purchase price. Annual property tax (IBI) on this villa averages €400-600. These costs are significantly lower than UK conveyancing expenses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jeg få boliglån i Spania som utlending?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers commonly secure Spanish mortgages at competitive rates (currently 2.5-4.5% depending on lender and loan-to-value ratio). Banks typically require 30% deposit, valid passport, proof of income, and NIE tax identification. British and other foreign nationals can borrow through Spanish banks like Ibercaja, CaixaBank, or Sabadell. UK expat mortgage brokers specialize in Spanish purchases and can advise on your specific situation. Many buyers also refinance through UK lenders."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hva er levekostnadene på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca living costs are 25-35% lower than UK equivalents. Groceries, dining, and utilities cost substantially less—a family's monthly budget might run €1,200-1,800 for comfortable living, compared to €2,500-3,500 in equivalent UK locations. Healthcare through Spanish insurance (€100-150 monthly) is extremely affordable. Fuel, property maintenance, and services are all more economical. The Mediterranean climate reduces heating costs. Many families find their disposable income increases significantly after moving to Spain."
    },
    {
      "question": "Er Costa Blanca bra for pensjonister?",
      "answer": "Excellent, yes—retirees comprise a significant portion of Costa Blanca's international population. Healthcare is outstanding, cost of living is low, climate is perfect for year-round activity, and established expat communities provide social connections. Baños y Mendigo specifically offers quieter, more authentic living than beach resorts. Residency requirements are straightforward through the Non-Lucrative Visa (requiring €1,080 monthly income proof). Many British retirees enjoy twice the lifestyle quality they had in the UK at similar or lower total costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hvordan er været på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Exceptional—Costa Blanca enjoys 320+ days of sunshine annually with Mediterranean climate characteristics. Summers (June-September) are warm and dry, 28-35°C, while winters remain mild, 10-18°C. Rainfall is minimal and concentrated in autumn/spring. This climate is perfect for families—outdoor activities are viable year-round, heating costs are negligible, and seasonal variety prevents monotony. Children benefit from outdoor play opportunities in virtually every month. The consistent sunshine is particularly beneficial for families relocating from cloudy UK climates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hvor langt er det fra Norge til Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is approximately 1,000 miles from the UK. Flight time from London/Manchester to Alicante-Elche Airport is 2.5-3 hours direct, with departures 5-10 times daily from major airports. Budget airlines make visits home affordable, and 2-hour flights mean weekend visits are feasible. Many expat families maintain UK connections while building Spanish lives. The proximity enables grandparents to visit frequently and children to visit UK relatives without excessive travel burden."
    },
    {
      "question": "What schools are available for international children in Baños y Mendigo?",
      "answer": "International schools in the surrounding region offer British curriculum education (GCSE, A-Level) with English instruction. The International School of Murcia is 12 km away and serves expat families throughout the region. Local Spanish bilingual schools provide excellent Spanish education with English support, creating genuinely bilingual children within 2-3 years. Class sizes are smaller than UK equivalents, fees are 40-60% lower than private UK schools, and facilities are modern. Many families report their children thrive in the relaxed, supportive environment."
