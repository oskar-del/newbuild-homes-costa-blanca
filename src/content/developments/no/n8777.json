  "heroIntro": "Imagine waking up to Spanish sunshine in your own private penthouse, a sanctuary that's distinctly yours yet perfectly positioned for Mediterranean exploration. This exceptional 2-bedroom penthouse in Hondón de las Nieves represents a rare opportunity: a holiday home with serious investment credentials, priced at €220,000—a remarkable 40% less than comparable properties on Spain's island markets. Whether you're seeking a personal sunshine retreat for long summers, a sophisticated getaway destination, or a second home that pays for itself through rental income, this property delivers on every front.\n\nHondón de las Nieves isn't another crowded coastal resort. Nestled in the heart of the Costa Blanca interior, this charming pueblo offers the authentic Spanish lifestyle that holiday home buyers genuinely crave—whitewashed architecture, genuine local character, and an international community that's genuinely welcoming. At 93m² of thoughtfully designed space, this penthouse maximizes every square meter with clean lines and premium finishes. The location itself is the secret weapon: close enough to reach Blue Flag beaches within 20 minutes, yet removed from the tourist crowds that define other Mediterranean destinations.",
  "areaSection": "Hondón de las Nieves sits in the verdant foothills of inland Costa Blanca, where the landscape transforms from coastal plains into gentle mountainous terrain. This pueblo of approximately 1,200 residents has become increasingly popular with discerning international buyers seeking authenticity over artifice. The area experiences 300+ days of annual sunshine—genuine Mediterranean climate without the extreme heat of southern coastal zones. Elevation (around 600m) creates naturally pleasant temperatures even in summer, while winters remain mild and green. The village maintains traditional Spanish charm: narrow streets, local restaurants serving regional cuisine, and a genuine sense of community that resists the commercialization found in larger resorts. Proximity to both beaches and major services makes it uniquely versatile for holiday homeowners.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Life in Hondón de las Nieves revolves around authentic Mediterranean rhythms merged with modern conveniences. Your daily experience includes morning paseos through village streets lined with bougainvillea and mature trees, local cafés where English is widely spoken, and weekly markets bursting with regional produce. The international community here—established over two decades—has created excellent support networks without sacrificing Spanish character. You'll find restaurants serving everything from traditional espetos (grilled fish) to modern Mediterranean cuisine, all within the pueblo or nearby towns. Healthcare is excellent: private clinics operate throughout the region with English-speaking doctors, and regional hospitals are 30 minutes away. Supermarkets (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum) sit alongside traditional markets. The beaches of Benidorm and Denia, with their celebrated Blue Flag status, remain just 20 minutes away for when you want coastal drama. Golf enthusiasts will appreciate championship courses throughout the region.",

Priced at €2,366/m² in an area averaging €2,200/m², you're acquiring premium-specification construction with minimal premium.
