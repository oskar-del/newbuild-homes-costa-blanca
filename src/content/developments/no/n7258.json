    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlendinger kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners can freely purchase Spanish property without residency requirements or government approval. EU citizens enjoy identical rights to Spanish nationals, while non-EU citizens require a NIE (Spanish tax identification number) obtainable during the purchase process. The legal process is straightforward, typically requiring a Spanish lawyer and notary to facilitate title transfer and registration. Spain actively encourages international property investment through transparent legal frameworks and competitive financing options."
    },
    {
      "question": "Er Costa Blanca et godt sted å kjøpe eiendom?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca remains an excellent property investment region, though savvy buyers increasingly explore inland alternatives like Yecla offering superior value and authenticity. The coast experiences high appreciation in premium locations, yet Yecla delivers equivalent lifestyle amenities with 40% cost savings and stronger year-on-year growth rates. Both coastal and inland regions attract established international communities, excellent healthcare, and robust infrastructure, but inland purchases provide superior privacy, development potential, and investment fundamentals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hva koster det å kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "Total acquisition costs typically range from 8-10% above the purchase price. This includes 6-7% property transfer tax (ITP), notary fees of approximately 0.5%, property registration costs around 0.1%, and legal representation fees typically 1-2%. Buyers should budget €68,000-€88,000 in addition to the €800,000 purchase price. These costs are non-negotiable and standardized across Spanish property transactions, with seller typically covering agent commissions rather than buyers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Trenger jeg visum for å kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "Property ownership alone does not require Spanish visa sponsorship. EU/EEA citizens enjoy unrestricted residence rights, while non-EU citizens may pursue the Spanish investor visa (requiring €500,000 investment minimum) or temporary residence permits through other pathways. Property acquisition follows identical legal procedures regardless of residency status. Many international property owners maintain primary residences elsewhere while enjoying Spanish property use throughout the year, particularly under favorable Spanish residency taxation agreements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hva er levekostnadene på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Cost of living in Yecla averages 20-30% lower than Northern European standards while maintaining equivalent quality. Rental apartments range €400-€800 monthly, quality dining €12-€25 per person, and utilities average €80-€150 monthly. Healthcare costs remain minimal even for private services, utilities stay affordable, and domestic services including housekeeping cost significantly less than Northern Europe.

    },
    {
      "question": "Er Costa Blanca bra for pensjonister?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca, particularly inland alternatives like Yecla, represents an outstanding retirement destination. The region offers excellent healthcare facilities with English-speaking physicians, well-established expatriate communities facilitating social integration, and climate benefits supporting active lifestyles year-round. Proximity to European airports enables regular family visits, while cost of living efficiency stretches retirement income substantially. The international community provides familiar cultural amenities while encouraging engagement with authentic Spanish life, offering optimal balance for sophisticated retirees seeking both comfort and adventure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hvor langt er det fra Norge til Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Alicante-Elche Airport, 45 minutes from this property, offers direct flights to London (Gatwick, Stansted, Luton) typically completing in 2.5-3 hours. Budget carriers provide multiple daily frequencies with competitive pricing, typically €40-€120 return for advance booking. Alternative routing through Valencia Airport provides equivalent accessibility. The geographic proximity enables frequent UK visits while maintaining Mediterranean residence, making the region ideal for UK-based buyers maintaining business interests or family connections in Britain."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hvordan er været på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Yecla enjoys Mediterranean climate with approximately 300 days of annual sunshine, mild winters (average 8-12°C), and warm summers (average 25-28°C) moderated by 630-meter elevation. Coastal areas experience slightly warmer winters but same summer temperatures. Rainfall concentrates in autumn/spring with minimal winter precipitation. The climate supports outdoor activities year-round while providing natural cooling preventing oppressive summer heat common in lower elevations. Spring and autumn offer optimal conditions with minimal temperature extremes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jeg få boliglån i Spania som utlending?",
      "answer": "Yes, Spanish banks readily provide mortgages to qualified foreign buyers, typically offering 60-80% loan-to-value financing at competitive rates currently ranging 3-4% for 20-30 year terms. International income documentation, personal identification, and credit history assessment facilitate approval processes similar to other European jurisdictions. Many banks now specialize in expatriate financing, simplifying documentation through English-language services and international employment verification. Non-resident foreigners typically face marginally higher rates than Spanish residents, but financing remains accessible and favorable for creditworthy buyers, potentially reducing the €800,000 cash requirement substantially."
