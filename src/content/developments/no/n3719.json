  "investmentSection": "Los Altos has established itself as one of Torrevieja's most reliable rental markets, attracting European families seeking 6-12 month contracts rather than transient tourists. The proximity to schools, hospitals, and supermarkets makes it particularly attractive to relocating professionals and retirees. A properly maintained villa in this location typically generates €800-1,100 monthly rental income during off-peak seasons and €1,400-1,800 during summer months. The relatively low utility costs thanks to aerothermic technology and the four-bathroom layout (reducing guest complaints) contribute to strong guest reviews and repeat bookings.\n\nTorrevieja's established expat infrastructure, lower property taxes than northern Europe, and proximity to Alicante airport (45km) continue to drive residential demand. Unlike speculative beachfront properties, inland locations like Los Altos offer more stable valuations and consistent rental demand from families prioritizing practicality over ocean views.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What makes Los Altos different from other Torrevieja urbanizations?",
      "answer": "Los Altos is one of the oldest consolidated urbanizations in Torrevieja, meaning it has 30+ years of proven infrastructure, mature landscaping, and established community services. Unlike newer developments, you're buying into an area where schools, hospitals, and supermarkets are already fully operational and proven reliable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does the aerothermic system save on utilities?",
      "answer": "Aerothermic heat pumps typically reduce hot water and heating costs by 60-70% compared to electric boilers or gas systems. In a villa like this with underfloor heating, annual savings typically range from €600-1,200 depending on usage patterns and seasonal occupation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is four bathrooms genuinely necessary in a 3-bedroom villa?",
      "answer": "Absolutely, particularly if you intend rental use or frequent visitors. One bathroom per bedroom plus a guest bathroom eliminates conflicts and significantly improves guest satisfaction ratings, which directly impacts rental income and booking rates. It's one of the most valuable features in this property."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the rental potential for properties in Los Altos specifically?",
      "answer": "Los Altos attracts primarily family rentals and medium-term stays rather than beach tourists. Monthly rates for comparable villas range €900-1,200 in winter and €1,500-2,000 in summer. The area maintains consistent occupancy because families value the proximity to schools and practical amenities over beachfront location."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far is Alicante airport and how does that affect property value?",
      "answer": "Alicante-Elche Airport is 45km north of Torrevieja - approximately 50 minutes by car. This proximity makes the area attractive to international buyers and rental guests, particularly from the UK, Germany, and Scandinavia. It's close enough for convenience but far enough to avoid airplane noise or airport-adjacent development."
    },
    {
      "question": "What costs should I anticipate beyond the purchase price?",
      "answer": "Annual urbanization fees (community) run approximately €1,200-1,600 depending on services included. Property taxes (IBI) are typically €400-600 annually. Utilities for a well-insulated villa with aerothermic heating average €150-250 monthly. Travel to the coast or city center costs less than €10 per trip given the proximity."
