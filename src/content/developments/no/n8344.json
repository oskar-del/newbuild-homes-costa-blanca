  "areaSection": "San Juan de los Terreros is a charming coastal town in Almería, eastern Costa Blanca, known for its authentic Spanish character and family-friendly atmosphere. Located between the popular resorts of Mojácar and Vera, it offers the best of both worlds—access to modern amenities while maintaining a genuine local feel. The Mediterranean climate brings over 300 days of sunshine annually, with mild winters and warm summers perfect for outdoor family activities. The town's pristine beaches feature Blue Flag status, indicating excellent water quality and safety standards. The wider Almería region has experienced steady infrastructure development, making it increasingly attractive to families seeking value without compromising on convenience.
