    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlendinger kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign nationals can purchase Spanish property without restriction or requirement to obtain Spanish residency. Most international purchasers require a Spanish Tax Identification Number (NIE), easily obtained through the Spanish consulate or upon arrival. Legal frameworks strongly protect non-resident property owners, and English-speaking legal professionals specialise in expatriate acquisitions throughout Costa Blanca."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hva koster det å kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, anticipated acquisition costs typically include: property transfer tax (6-8%), legal fees (1-2%), and notary costs (0.5-1%). Total transaction costs generally range 7-11% of the purchase price. Årlige eiendomsskatter (IBI) average 0.4-0.7% of estimated property value. These costs are significantly lower than equivalent transactions in Northern European property markets."
    },
    {
      "question": "Trenger jeg visum for å kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically to purchase Spanish property. EU and UK nationals require appropriate residency documentation if intending to reside in Spain long-term, but property acquisition itself has no visa prerequisites. Many international purchasers acquire property while maintaining primary residences elsewhere, without establishing Spanish tax residency."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jeg få boliglån i Spania som utlending?",
      "answer": "Yes, Spanish banks provide mortgages to non-resident foreign purchasers, typically covering 60-80% of property value. Interest rates remain competitive by international standards. Santander, BBVA, and specialised expatriate lenders routinely finance international property acquisitions. English-speaking mortgage advisors can guide foreign purchasers through application processes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Er Costa Blanca et godt sted å kjøpe eiendom?",

Mediterranean climate, healthcare excellence, and cultural amenities enhance lifestyle quality beyond financial considerations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hva er levekostnadene på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Cost of living in Benitachell remains significantly lower than Northern European equivalents. Monthly expenses for a couple—including utilities, groceries, dining, and entertainment—typically range €2,000-3,500. Healthcare costs are minimised through Spanish national insurance or affordable private coverage. Property maintenance costs align with Mediterranean standards, approximately 1% of property value annually."
    },
    {
      "question": "Er Costa Blanca bra for pensjonister?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca has become exceptionally popular among affluent retirees from Northern Europe. Climate stability, affordable cost of living, healthcare accessibility, established expatriate communities, cultural activities, and leisure facilities (golf, beaches, restaurants) create ideal retirement environments. Many retirees split time between Mediterranean residences and Northern European properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hvordan er været på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys 300 annual sunshine days with average temperatures of 25°C in summer and 15°C in winter—significantly milder than Northern European climates. Rainfall concentrates in autumn and spring; summers remain dry and warm. This climate stability supports year-round outdoor activities and eliminates seasonal heating requirements, reducing utility costs substantially."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far is Cumbre del Sol from Alicante Airport?",
      "answer": "Cumbre del Sol in Benitachell lies approximately 75 kilometres (approximately 1 hour 15 minutes drive) north of Alicante-Elche Airport. Direct motorway access via the AP-7 coastal highway provides efficient transportation. Private chauffeur services and airport transfer specialists routinely facilitate international travel for residents."
