  "metaTitle": "€345k 2-Bed Apartment Finestrat | Investeringsmulighet",
  "metaDescription": "2-bedroom apartment in Finestrat, Costa Blanca. €345,000. Premium build, 40% less than island markets. Strong rental yield potential.",
  "heroIntro": "This 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Finestrat represents a compelling investment opportunity on the Costa Blanca. Priced at €345,000 with premium specifications at just €3,920/m², this property sits well below comparable island markets while capturing the region's impressive 8% year-on-year appreciation trend. For investors seeking holiday let income, the numbers are attractive: typical weekly rental rates of €800 position this asset for strong returns in a high-demand coastal market. Finestrat's strategic location between Benidorm's tourism infrastructure and quieter residential areas creates dual appeal—attracting both holidaymakers seeking authentic Mediterranean living and long-term residents seeking capital appreciation. The 88m² layout maximizes usable space for furnished holiday rentals, while the two separate bathrooms support concurrent guest accommodations. This property targets serious investors looking to capitalize on Costa Blanca's sustained growth without the premium pricing of established resort destinations.",
  "areaSection": "Finestrat occupies a prime position on the Costa Blanca, nestled between the Sierra de Aitana mountains and the Mediterranean Sea. This strategic location places it just 12km from Benidorm's international airport access points and tourist infrastructure, yet maintains the quieter character preferred by discerning buyers. The municipality benefits from year-round Mediterranean climate with 300+ days of sunshine annually, supporting both tourism and residential markets. Finestrat's geography—elevated residential areas overlooking coastal developments—creates natural demand segmentation. The town has evolved from agricultural roots into a balanced residential-tourism hub, attracting European retirees, young families, and investment-focused buyers. Local infrastructure investment has been substantial, with modern amenities complementing traditional Spanish village character in the old town.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Finestrat balances authentic Spanish culture with cosmopolitan convenience. The established expat community—primarily British, German, and Scandinavian—means English is widely spoken in shops, restaurants, and professional services. Mercadona, Lidl, and Consum supermarkets provide familiar shopping routines, while weekly markets offer local produce at competitive prices. Healthcare access is excellent: the regional hospital in nearby Benidorm operates with English-speaking staff, and private clinics throughout the area cater to international residents. The international school network serves families with British curriculum options and IB programs. Leisure activities dominate lifestyle: multiple Blue Flag beaches lie within 20 minutes, championship golf courses operate year-round, and the 2,500m Sierra de Aitana offers hiking and nature activities. Restaurant options range from traditional Spanish chiringuitos to international cuisines. The resident expat network organizes regular social events, cultural activities, and community groups, reducing isolation for newcomers.",
  "investmentSection": "Finestrat demonstrates sustained investment fundamentals: 8% year-on-year property appreciation outpaces many European markets, while this property's €3,920/m² pricing sits 40% below Spanish island benchmarks (Balearics, Canaries). The holiday let market supports €800/week typical rental rates—approximately €3,200 monthly, translating to potential 11%+ gross yields before operational expenses. Finestrat attracts diverse rental demographics: summer beachgoers, golf tourists (championship courses nearby), and shoulder-season retirees. The two-bedroom configuration commands premium holiday let rates while maintaining mass-market appeal. Capital appreciation potential connects to infrastructure: airport expansion, regional tourism development, and the Costa Blanca's consistent 5-8 year cycle upswing. Compared to Torrevieja (oversaturated), Orihuela (slower growth), and Altea (premium-priced), Finestrat occupies an optimal value position: established enough for stable demand, yet still appreciating faster than mature markets.",
  "conclusion": "This €345,000 two-bedroom apartment in Finestrat represents a disciplined investment opportunity combining capital appreciation potential with established holiday rental income. The premium specification pricing—justifiable through superior finishes and dual-bathroom layout—remains competitively positioned against regional comparables while offering 40% savings versus Spanish island markets. With typical rental rates supporting 11%+ gross yields and regional appreciation averaging 8% annually, the property serves both income and wealth-building objectives. Finestrat's strategic location, established expat infrastructure, and dual-market appeal (holiday rentals plus long-term residential) reduce investment risk compared to single-purpose coastal properties. For serious property investors seeking Costa Blanca exposure with manageable risk profiles and transparent return mechanics, this property merits immediate investigation.
