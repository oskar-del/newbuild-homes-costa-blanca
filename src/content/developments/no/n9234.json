    {
      "question": "Er Costa Blanca et godt sted å kjøpe eiendom?",
      "answer": "Yes, particularly San Pedro del Pinatar as a destination. Costa Blanca combines year-round Mediterranean climate, established expatriate communities with English-speaking services, property market appreciation averaging 8% annually, and direct airport connectivity.

    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlendinger kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "Yes, Spain welcomes foreign property ownership without nationality restrictions. EU citizens enjoy full property ownership rights. Non-EU citizens can purchase property, though some regions have restrictions on agricultural land. The purchase process requires a Spanish Tax Identification Number (NIE) and professional legal representation. Most international buyers work with English-speaking abogados (lawyers) specializing in expatriate purchases, streamlining documentation and ensuring compliance with local regulations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hva koster det å kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect approximately 8-10% in total acquisition costs, including: transfer tax (6-7%), notary fees (0.5-1%), and legal/administrative fees (1-2%). Annual ownership costs include property tax (0.4-0.6% of registered value), municipal waste collection, and optional private insurance. Unlike some countries, Spain has no ongoing capital gains tax for primary residences held long-term, making property ownership particularly efficient for residential buyers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hva er levekostnadene på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "San Pedro del Pinatar offers exceptional cost of living compared to northern Europe. Groceries, utilities, and dining are significantly less expensive than UK or northern Europe—a couple's comfortable lifestyle costs €1,500-2,500 monthly including accommodations, utilities, and leisure. Healthcare through Spain's public system is heavily subsidized for residents. Property taxes are among Europe's lowest. The major cost advantage lies in utilities (heating largely unnecessary), healthcare efficiency, and food costs driven by Mediterranean agricultural abundance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jeg få boliglån i Spania som utlending?",
      "answer": "Yes, Spanish banks extend mortgages to foreign buyers and residents, typically offering 60-80% loan-to-value financing at competitive EU interest rates. Major international banks (BBVA, CaixaBank, Santander) have English-speaking mortgage specialists familiar with expatriate requirements. Non-resident non-EU citizens may face slightly more restrictive terms. Many buyers find Spanish mortgages advantageous compared to home country financing. Professional mortgage brokers specializing in expatriate lending streamline the process significantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hvordan er været på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "San Pedro del Pinatar enjoys exceptional Mediterranean climate: 320+ days of annual sunshine, summer temperatures reaching 28-32°C (82-90°F), and mild winters averaging 10-15°C (50-59°F). Rainfall concentrates in autumn and spring; summers are essentially dry. The unique position between Mar Menor and Mediterranean creates a microclimate with excellent air quality. This weather pattern supports year-round outdoor entertaining, water sports, and leisure activities, eliminating the seasonal limitations of northern European properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this property a good investment?",
      "answer": "Yes, for multiple reasons: the €5,094/m² specification is 40% below comparable island market pricing; the area demonstrates 8% year-on-year appreciation; rental income potential supports 4-5% annual returns for non-primary residence owners; Spain's property market fundamentals remain strong with balanced supply-demand dynamics; and long-term ownership incurs minimal annual taxation. The combination of personal lifestyle benefits, appreciation potential, and income generation creates a compelling investment case."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hvor langt er det fra Norge til Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Approximately 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) from London. Alicante Airport, 45 minutes from San Pedro del Pinatar, offers direct flights to UK airports (London Gatwick, Stansted, Manchester, Birmingham) with typical flight times of 2.5-3 hours. Multiple daily flights and budget airline competition keep airfares economical (€30-80 for advance bookings), making frequent UK visits practical for retirees or semi-retired buyers maintaining UK connections."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is San Pedro del Pinatar good for retirees?",
      "answer": "Excellent for retirees seeking an active Mediterranean lifestyle. The established expatriate community provides social networks and English-speaking services eliminating isolation.

The cost of living is 30-40% less than UK equivalents, extending retirement savings significantly. Year-round outdoor climate supports active pursuits including golf, water sports, and coastal walks. Many retirees organize their affairs for Spanish residency, accessing reciprocal healthcare agreements with the UK under recent agreements."
