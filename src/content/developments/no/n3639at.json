The town's distinctive geography creates natural amphitheater conditions that maximise coastal vistas while minimising weather exposure. With over 320 days of annual sunshine and mild winters averaging 15°C, Benidorm delivers consistent climate advantages that underpin its status as Europe's premier year-round destination. The Poniente neighbourhood anchors Benidorm's western exposure, commanding panoramic maritime views and direct beach access via dedicated promenades. The area's evolution from fishing village to integrated luxury resort has maintained architectural character while introducing contemporary amenities that serve international residents. Strategic positioning between Valencia (2 hours) and Málaga (3.5 hours), combined with Alicante-Elche airport access (45 minutes), establishes Benidorm as Europe's most accessible Mediterranean coastal community for discerning international purchasers.",

International demand from Northern Europe, Scandinavia, and UK purchasers continues diversifying buyer demographics beyond traditional Spanish clientele.
