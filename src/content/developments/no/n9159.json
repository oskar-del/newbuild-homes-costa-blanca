Resort amenities enhance rental appeal compared to standalone apartments, justifying premium nightly rates of €800+ for 7-night bookings."
    },
    {
      "question": "What documents do I need to purchase property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Essential documents include valid passport, proof of NIE registration, bank statements confirming funds, and mortgage pre-approval (if applicable).
