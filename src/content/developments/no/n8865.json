      "question": "Hvor mye koster denne eiendommen?",
      "answer": "€354,900. This is the complete purchase price for the 3-bedroom villa with 600m² plot in Hacienda del Alamo. No hidden costs apply to this figure, though standard Spanish purchase costs (notary, land registry, legal fees) typically add 8-10%. Many buyers finance through Spanish mortgages at competitive rates, and currency fluctuations from GBP affect purchasing power."
    },
    {
      "question": "Er Costa Blanca et godt sted å kjøpe eiendom?",
      "answer": "Yes, Costa Blanca offers excellent value and lifestyle for families, especially in emerging areas like Fuente Álamo.

    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlendinger kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "Yes, non-EU foreigners can purchase Spanish property with no restrictions, though some nationalities require authorization (rarely denied). EU citizens including UK residents post-Brexit face minimal barriers. You'll need a Spanish tax number (NIE), and English-speaking lawyers handle conveyancing. Most international buyers find the process straightforward with proper legal support, taking 4-6 weeks from offer to completion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hva koster det å kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",

In Murcia, transfer tax is 6%. You'll also budget for NIE registration and property surveys if desired. Budgeting €32,000-€38,000 in additional costs for this €354,900 property is prudent."
    },

      "question": "Hva er levekostnadene på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Cost of living in Fuente Álamo is 25-35% lower than UK averages. Supermarket shopping costs significantly less, restaurants offer three-course meals for €10-15, and utilities (electricity, water, gas) are affordable. Healthcare is accessible and inexpensive. A family of four budgeting €1,800-2,200 monthly for living expenses (excluding mortgage) can live comfortably, compared to £2,800+ in comparable UK towns."

      "answer": "Alicante-Elche Airport (35 minutes from Fuente Álamo) operates 2+ daily flights to UK destinations including London, Manchester, and Birmingham, with flight times around 2 hours. Ferry routes from southern Spain to UK are available but require 24+ hour journeys.

    },
    {
      "question": "Trenger jeg visum for å kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically to purchase property. UK citizens post-Brexit can visit Spain visa-free for 90 days within 180 days. For longer-term residence (retiring or relocating), you'll need appropriate visas or residence permits. EU citizens enjoy unrestricted movement. Property purchase itself is administratively separate from residency status—many international buyers hold property without permanent residence, visiting seasonally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jeg få boliglån i Spania som utlending?",
      "answer": "Yes, UK and other foreign nationals frequently obtain Spanish mortgages at competitive rates. Spanish banks typically offer 60-80% loan-to-value financing for non-residents, with rates currently 3.5-4.5%. You'll need proof of income, identification, and often a Spanish tax number. English-speaking mortgage brokers facilitate the process, typically taking 4-6 weeks. Many families find Spanish mortgages cheaper than UK equivalents, particularly for investment properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this villa suitable for families with young children?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. The 600m² plot provides safe outdoor space for play and gardens away from traffic. Two bathrooms accommodate morning routines with multiple children. The 3-bedroom layout offers separate sleeping arrangements, and the family-focused Hacienda del Alamo community features other families with similar-aged children. Proximity to schools (12 minutes), healthcare (28 minutes), and beaches (20 minutes) suits families perfectly. The quiet location and modern construction provide safety and reliability."
