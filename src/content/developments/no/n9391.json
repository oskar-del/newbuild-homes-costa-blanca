    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlendinger kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners can purchase property in Spain without restrictions. UK, US, and EU citizens enjoy full ownership rights identical to Spanish citizens. The legal process is straightforward with English-speaking lawyers guiding you through documentation. You'll need an NIE (Spanish tax identification number) and should budget 6-8% additional costs for taxes, legal fees, and registration.

    },
    {
      "question": "Hva er levekostnadene på Costa Blanca?",

      "answer": "Budget 6-8% above the purchase price for acquisition costs. This includes: 6-10% transfer tax (varies by region), 0.4-0.5% notary fees, 0.1% land registry costs, and professional advisor fees (€1,500-3,000). For a €359,000 property, expect total acquisition costs of approximately €21,500-28,700. Mortgage arrangement fees add an additional 0.5-1% if financing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jeg få boliglån i Spania som utlending?",
      "answer": "Yes, many foreign buyers successfully obtain Spanish mortgages. Spanish banks typically lend 70-80% of property value to non-residents with proof of income.

Year-round demand from couples and small families targeting authentic pueblo experiences suggests conservative €25,000-30,000 annual rental income. Professional property management companies handle bookings, cleaning, and guest relations for 20-25% commission."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need special residency status to own this property?",
      "answer": "No formal residency requirement exists for property ownership. You can purchase as a non-resident using your passport and obtaining an NIE (Spanish tax number). However, spending more than 183 days annually triggers Spanish tax residency, requiring annual tax returns on worldwide income. Many property owners spend 3-4 months yearly without tax residency complications, enjoying the property seasonally while maintaining primary residence elsewhere."
