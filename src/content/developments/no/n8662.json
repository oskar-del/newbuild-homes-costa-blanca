  "metaTitle": "2 Soverom Town House Dolores €259,000 | Costa Blanca",
  "metaDescription": "Fantastisk 2-bedroom town house in Dolores, Costa Blanca. €259,000. Premium spec, 40% cheaper than Spanish islands. Your Mediterranean escape awaits.",
  "heroIntro": "Imagine waking up to Mediterranean sunshine, stepping onto your own Spanish terrace, and knowing you've found the perfect holiday home without breaking the bank. This exceptional 2-bedroom, 3-bathroom town house in Dolores represents a rare opportunity: premium specification at €259,000 (just €2,977/m²), which is 40% less expensive than comparable properties on Spanish islands. Dolores is where discerning holiday home buyers discover authentic Costa Blanca living—close enough to pristine beaches for weekend escapes, yet peacefully removed from overdeveloped tourist zones. With 12 stunning images showcasing the property's modern finishes and thoughtful design, this 87m² residence offers the ideal balance of compact elegance and full amenities. Whether you're seeking a sunshine retreat for golden-hour sunsets, a Mediterranean escape for family holidays, or a smart investment with proven rental demand (€800 per week typical), this Dolores town house delivers everything the modern holiday home owner desires.",
  "areaSection": "Dolores sits in the heart of the Vega Baja region, inland from the glittering Costa Blanca coastline yet perfectly positioned for easy access to both beaches and authentic Spanish culture. This charming town benefits from the region's characteristic Mediterranean climate: over 300 days of annual sunshine, mild winters, and warm, dry summers that make outdoor living genuinely year-round. Unlike the packed tourist beaches of Benidorm or Torrevieja, Dolores maintains a relaxed, local atmosphere where Spanish traditions and international residents coexist harmoniously. The town's elevation provides natural cooling breezes during summer months, while the surrounding agricultural landscape—famous for citrus groves and date palms—creates a picturesque, peaceful setting. Dolores is the gateway to hidden gems: unspoiled Blue Flag beaches just 20 minutes south, championship golf courses for enthusiasts, and charming villages perfect for exploring on weekends.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Life in Dolores means embracing a slower, more authentic Mediterranean rhythm without sacrificing modern convenience. Your mornings might start at one of the local cafés with a café con leche and churros, chatting with an established expat community where English is widely spoken. The weekly markets burst with fresh produce from nearby farms—tomatoes that taste like tomatoes, olives still warm from pressing. Supermarkets like Mercadona and Lidl provide familiar staples, while independent shops line the town centre for those special discoveries. Evenings often drift toward local restaurants serving paella and fresh seafood at prices that feel refreshingly honest. The international community here is genuinely welcoming; you'll find book clubs, social groups, and friendship circles already formed. Healthcare is reassuringly excellent with English-speaking doctors readily available. For beach days, the 20-minute drive brings you to multiple Blue Flag beaches; for golf, several championship courses welcome visitors. Dolores delivers the authentic Spanish experience that holiday home owners dream about—genuine, unpretentious, and utterly livable.",
  "investmentSection": "Beyond the lifestyle appeal, this Dolores town house represents genuine investment value. At €2,977/m², you're purchasing at a 35% premium to Dolores' €2,200/m² average—justified by the property's premium specification—yet still capitalising on strong market momentum. Costa Blanca property values have increased 8% year-on-year, significantly outpacing inflation. The rental market validates the investment: similar properties achieve €800 per week during peak season (July-August), with shoulder seasons (May-June, September) commanding €500-600 weekly. Conservative estimates suggest 4-5% annual rental yields, making this property work hard during your absence. European buyers increasingly recognise Costa Blanca as a stable, regulated property market with transparent legal frameworks. Currency diversification, lifestyle flexibility, and potential capital appreciation combine to make holiday home ownership here genuinely compelling.",
  "conclusion": "This Dolores town house represents a genuinely rare opportunity: premium specification, proven investment demand, and authentic Mediterranean lifestyle at a price that would barely secure a studio on Mallorca. With 300 days annual sunshine, 20-minute beach access, excellent healthcare, and an established English-speaking community, this isn't merely a property purchase—it's a ticket to the lifestyle you've imagined. The 8% annual market growth, €800/week rental demand, and 40% savings versus Spanish island equivalents combine to make this both an exceptional lifestyle choice and a smart investment. Your Mediterranean escape awaits. Contact us via WhatsApp for viewings, financing guidance, or complete property information. Reference: N8662.",
