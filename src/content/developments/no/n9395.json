  "metaDescription": "Contemporary 2-bedroom apartment in La Hoya, Torrevieja. 65m² new build with premium amenities. Discover modern living on Costa Blanca.",
  "heroIntro": "Welcome to N9395, a thoughtfully designed 2-bedroom apartment nestled in La Hoya, one of Torrevieja's most dynamic residential neighbourhoods. This modern new build development represents a fresh approach to coastal living, combining contemporary architecture with practical design that responds to the needs of today's homeowners. With 65 square metres of carefully planned living space, this apartment offers the perfect balance between intimacy and functionality, making it an ideal choice for couples, small families, or investors seeking a reliable property in a growing area.\n\nTorrevieja has transformed significantly over the past decade, evolving from a traditional seaside town into a vibrant Mediterranean destination with modern infrastructure, excellent healthcare facilities, and diverse recreational opportunities. La Hoya, specifically, has become a focal point for quality residential development, attracting both permanent residents and those seeking holiday retreats. The neighbourhood benefits from strong connectivity to the town centre while maintaining a more tranquil, community-focused atmosphere that appeals to those wanting to escape the hustle of busier resort areas.\n\nThis apartment comes equipped with 2 full bathrooms, including an ensuite, and a dedicated laundry room – features that significantly enhance daily convenience. The complex itself features low-rise architecture arranged around generous communal spaces, fostering a genuine sense of community while preserving privacy. As part of a comprehensive new build development, residents gain access to premium shared amenities designed to enhance lifestyle quality without the maintenance responsibilities that come with individual properties.",
  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja has developed a robust tourism and permanent residency market that creates consistent rental demand. The combination of direct beach access, authentic Spanish character, and established expat infrastructure means properties here attract both short-term holiday visitors and long-term residential tenants. New build apartments with contemporary amenities command particular interest from rental investors, as guests increasingly expect modern finishes and facilities. La Hoya's position outside the main tourist zones actually benefits investors, as it attracts a more stable tenant base – permanent residents and families seeking longer-term rentals rather than volatile seasonal markets.\n\nThe Costa Blanca property market has shown resilience and steady appreciation over recent years, with Torrevieja emerging as an undervalued alternative to oversaturated markets. New build properties with formal warranties and modern amenities typically perform strongly, both for rental yield and future resale value. The proximity to amenities combined with reasonable acquisition costs makes this the type of property that appeals to both owner-occupiers and strategic investors seeking European real estate exposure.",
