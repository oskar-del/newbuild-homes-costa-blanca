This isn't a manufactured tourist destination—it's a genuine working town with a thriving Spanish community, enhanced by a sophisticated international presence. The climate is phenomenal: 320 days of sunshine annually, with winter temperatures rarely dropping below 15°C. The town's geography offers natural protection, with the Sierra de Callosa mountains providing shelter from northern winds while Mediterranean breezes keep summers refreshing. The local economy blends tourism, agriculture, and residential development, creating a balanced community rather than a seasonal ghost town. Within 20 minutes, you'll access multiple Blue Flag beaches; within 30 minutes, you reach Torrevieja's vibrant marina and Orihuela Costa's championship golf courses.",

Weekly markets burst with Mediterranean produce; restaurants range from formal establishments to chiringuitos serving fresh catch meters from the sea. The healthcare infrastructure reassures: a modern regional hospital operates 30 minutes away with English-speaking doctors, while private clinics cater to expats throughout the town. Schools include internationally-accredited options for families, and the established expat community means you're never isolated—there are book clubs, sports groups, and social networks ready to welcome newcomers. Yet you're never forced into an expat bubble; Spanish lessons, beach clubs, and local festivals keep you culturally engaged.",
