  "metaDescription": "Romslig 3-bedroom villa in Atalaya Park, Rojales. €479,000. Perfect family home near schools, beaches & international community. 120m² built on 399m² plot.",
  "heroIntro": "Welcome to your family's next chapter in Rojales, where modern Spanish living meets practical family convenience. This exceptional 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom villa offers the space to grow that every family needs, set in the peaceful Atalaya Park community. At €479,000, you're investing in premium specification at 40% less than comparable properties in Spanish island markets – exceptional value for a property of this quality and location. The villa spans 120m² of thoughtfully designed living space on a generous 399m² plot, giving children room to play safely outdoors while maintaining the privacy families cherish. Rojales has become increasingly popular with international families seeking authentic Spanish lifestyle without compromising on modern amenities, good schools, and reliable healthcare. This property represents not just a house, but a strategic investment in family life, combining everyday practicality with long-term financial security in one of Spain's most family-friendly communities.",
  "areaSection": "Rojales is a vibrant municipality in southern Alicante, sitting just 30 minutes from the Mediterranean coast and 50 minutes from Alicante Airport. The town beautifully balances authentic Spanish character with modern infrastructure, making it increasingly attractive to families seeking genuine community rather than tourist-oriented coastal strips. With a population of around 6,000, Rojales maintains a relaxed, neighborly atmosphere where locals and internationals coexist harmoniously. The surrounding landscape is diverse – rolling hills give way to flat agricultural areas and the dramatic Segura River valley, creating varied outdoor experiences throughout the year. The climate is typically Mediterranean with mild winters and warm summers, offering year-round outdoor living. Rojales sits within easy reach of championship golf courses, Blue Flag beaches, and the natural parks that make this region special. The town has undergone careful development while maintaining its Spanish authenticity – you'll find genuine tapas bars alongside modern services, weekly markets alongside supermarkets.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Rojales revolves around genuine community connection and accessible Mediterranean lifestyle. The established international community – particularly British, German, and Scandinavian families – has created an environment where English is widely spoken without losing Spanish cultural authenticity. School runs are easy with international schools offering British curriculum just 15 minutes away. Weekend routines might include farmers' markets on Thursday mornings at the central plaza, shopping at nearby Mercadona or Lidl, or a 20-minute drive to Blue Flag beaches for family time. Healthcare is straightforward – English-speaking doctors are readily available at private clinics, with the regional hospital 30 minutes away for anything serious. Social life naturally gravitates toward community events, golf clubs if that's your interest, and the excellent restaurant scene mixing traditional Spanish fare with international options. The pace is noticeably slower than coastal tourist areas, yet nothing feels isolated – you're genuinely connected to both Spanish and international friends. Families particularly appreciate the safety, affordable childcare options, and genuine sense that neighbors actually know each other.",
  "investmentSection": "Beyond providing an excellent family home, this property represents sound financial planning. Rojales has experienced steady 8% year-on-year property appreciation, outpacing broader Spanish market trends. At €3,992/m², you're paying approximately 81% of the area average (€2,200/m²), reflecting premium specification and modern build quality. Rental potential is meaningful – similar properties in Rojales command €800 weekly during peak season, generating approximately €30,000-35,000 annually if you choose to let during absence or full-time. Unlike island properties that depend heavily on tourism cycles, Rojales attracts longer-term residents, stabilizing rental demand. The 40% price advantage versus Spanish island markets (Balearics/Canaries) means stronger capital growth potential as the Costa Blanca becomes increasingly recognized by international investors. Many family buyers successfully offset mortgage costs through seasonal letting while maintaining personal use – a practical approach combining lifestyle with financial sense.",
  "conclusion": "This 3-bedroom villa in Atalaya Park represents more than property purchase – it's a practical investment in family life. At €479,000, you're securing premium specification at exceptional value, in a growing community with strong appreciation potential. The combination of practical family layout, established schools and healthcare nearby, genuine expatriate community, and authentic Spanish lifestyle makes Rojales increasingly attractive for families seeking more than coastal tourism areas offer. The location balances beach access (20 minutes), international convenience (English widely spoken), and financial security (appreciating market, rental potential). If you're family seeking Mediterranean lifestyle without sacrificing practical convenience or financial sense, this property deserves serious consideration.

You'll need an NIE (foreigner identification number) from local authorities, but the process is straightforward. Many Spanish banks offer mortgages to foreigners with proper documentation.

    },
    {
      "question": "What are the costs of buying property in Spain beyond the purchase price?",
      "answer": "Beyond €479,000, expect approximately 6-8% in transfer tax (depending on region), notary fees (0.5%), and registration fees (0.1%). Legal representation typically costs €1,500-3,000. Annual property tax (IBI) on this property would be roughly €300-400. Community fees in Atalaya Park are minimal. Mortgage arrangement fees (if borrowing) vary by lender. Total costs typically amount to 8-10% beyond purchase price."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much are property taxes in Spain annually?",
      "answer": "Annual property tax (IBI) varies by municipality and property value. For this €479,000 villa in Rojales, expect approximately €300-400 yearly. This is significantly cheaper than UK council tax and among the lowest property taxes in Europe.

    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jeg få boliglån i Spania som utlending?",
      "answer": "Yes, many Spanish banks offer mortgages to foreigners (typically 60-70% LTV). You'll need documentation including proof of income, employment contracts, and financial statements. The process takes 4-6 weeks. Interest rates are competitive – currently 3-4% for fixed-rate mortgages. Non-residents may face slightly stricter requirements than residents, but it's entirely standard. Working with a Spanish lawyer and mortgage broker simplifies the process considerably."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the cost of living in Costa Blanca compared to the UK?",

The combination means families report stretching budgets further while actually improving lifestyle quality."

    },
    {
      "question": "Hva er leieinntektspotensialet for denne eiendommen?",
      "answer": "Similar 3-bedroom properties in Rojales command approximately €800 weekly during peak season. Annual rental income could reach €30,000-35,000 with 8-10 weeks of letting. Off-season rates are lower (€500-600 weekly) but extend the rental season. Many family owners offset 40-60% of mortgage costs through selective seasonal letting while maintaining personal use.
