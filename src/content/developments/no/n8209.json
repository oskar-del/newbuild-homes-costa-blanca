However, many foreign retirees purchase outright given lower prices compared to UK/Northern Europe. Spanish savings banks and major institutions like CaixaBank, Santander, and BBVA actively work with foreign buyers. A Spanish lawyer can advise on optimal financing strategies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Trenger jeg visum for å kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically to purchase property. However, residence status depends on your nationality and length of stay. British nationals (post-Brexit) can stay 90 days visa-free but need residency permits for longer stays. EU/EEA citizens have freedom of movement. Many retirees obtain residency permits through the 'Golden Visa' program (investment route) or qualify through pension income. A lawyer can advise on the best path for your situation."
