  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What makes Torrevieja's centro different from beach-front properties?",
      "answer": "Centro properties offer superior value while maintaining beach access within 600 metres. You get the authentic Spanish town experience, local amenities, and competitive pricing without the premium charged for beachfront locations. This location works perfectly for those wanting flexibility between beach days and urban exploration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is 52m² sufficient for comfortable living?",
      "answer": "Modern European design standards make 52m² fully liveable for one person or couples without children. The newly built apartment likely features efficient kitchen design and open-plan living that maximizes the space perception and functionality. Many successful long-term rentals operate from similarly-sized units."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the rental potential for this property?",
      "answer": "Centro apartments attract both short-term tourists and medium-term expat rentals. New construction commands premium rates, typically €600-900 monthly for long-term or €30-50 nightly for short-term. Peak summer season sees significantly higher rates, making this suitable for hybrid rental strategies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Torrevieja's centro safe for residents?",
      "answer": "Yes, the centro has undergone significant revitalization and benefits from constant foot traffic, local police presence, and established community networks.

    },
    {
      "question": "What are typical monthly costs for residents?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How established is the Torrevieja property market?",
