  "metaDescription": "2-bedroom apartment in Playa del Torres, Villajoyosa. €468,000. Premium specification, 40% below island prices. Strong rental yields.",
  "heroIntro": "This 2-bedroom apartment in Playa del Torres represents a compelling investment opportunity on the Costa Blanca. Priced at €468,000, it offers exceptional value at €4,926/m² – significantly below comparable Spanish island markets (40% less) while maintaining premium specifications. The Costa Blanca property market has demonstrated consistent growth of +8% year-on-year, with Villajoyosa emerging as a high-demand destination for both holiday lets and permanent residences. For investors, the rental potential is substantial: comparable properties in this prime beachside location command €800+ per week during peak season, translating to annual rental income of €30,000-€40,000 depending on management strategy. This property sits at a strategic price point between the local average of €2,200/m² and the premium resort market, making it ideal for buy-to-let investors seeking capital appreciation combined with immediate income generation. The 95m² layout maximizes usable space, while the established expat community and robust infrastructure ensure consistent tenant demand throughout the year.",
  "areaSection": "Villajoyosa, locally known as La Vila Joiosa, sits on the northern Costa Blanca coast approximately 40km south of Alicante. The municipality stretches across 9.5km of Mediterranean coastline, characterized by dramatic rocky outcrops interspersed with sandy Blue Flag beaches. The town's elevation and position create a temperate microclimate with average temperatures of 17°C in winter and 27°C in summer, with over 300 days of annual sunshine. Playa del Torres is the northwestern neighborhood, positioned between the vibrant town center and quieter coastal villages. The area benefits from excellent road connectivity via the N-332 and proximity to major transport hubs, while maintaining a distinctly Spanish atmosphere despite substantial British and Northern European residency.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Villajoyosa balances authentic Spanish culture with international convenience. The town center features weekly markets, traditional tapas bars, and modern supermarkets (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum) within easy reach. The established expat community means English is widely spoken in shops, restaurants, and professional services, eliminating language barriers for UK and Northern European buyers. Healthcare is accessible through Regional Hospital facilities 30 minutes away and private clinics with English-speaking doctors throughout the municipality. International schools offering British curriculum options serve families in the broader region. Weekend activities center on the multiple Blue Flag beaches (20 minutes away), water sports, championship golf courses, and hiking in nearby mountains. The proximity to Alicante Airport (40km) makes the location perfect for managing holiday lets while maintaining flexibility for frequent travel.",
  "investmentSection": "The Costa Blanca property market has outperformed national averages with consistent +8% year-on-year appreciation. This Villajoyosa property captures that growth trajectory while offering immediate rental income potential. Comparable 2-bedroom apartments in beachside locations command €800+ per week during peak season (May-September), with shoulder seasons (April, October) generating €600-€700 weekly. Conservative annual estimates suggest €30,000-€40,000 gross rental income, yielding 6.4-8.5% on the purchase price. The premium specification at significantly below-island pricing (40% discount vs. Balearics/Canaries) provides capital appreciation upside, while the dual-market appeal – holiday lets plus long-term rentals – reduces vacancy risk. Villajoyosa's location between Benidorm's tourism infrastructure and quieter coastal communities positions it optimally for diversified income generation.",
