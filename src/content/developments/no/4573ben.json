      "question": "Kan utlendinger kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "Yes, non-Spanish citizens enjoy full rights to purchase residential property in Spain without restrictions or residency requirements. Foreign buyers must obtain a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and follow standard conveyancing procedures. Spanish property law treats foreign and domestic buyers equivalently, ensuring transparent transaction frameworks and robust legal protections. Our legal specialists provide comprehensive guidance throughout the acquisition process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hva koster det å kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "Property acquisition costs in Spain typically total 8-12% of purchase price, including transfer tax (6-10%), notary fees (0.5-1%), and legal/administrative expenses (1-2%). For this €1,890,000 property, anticipate total acquisition costs of approximately €151,000-€227,000. Additional ongoing expenses include annual property taxes (0.4-1.1% of cadastral value), community fees if applicable, and utility costs. These expenses remain substantially lower than UK equivalents, contributing to Spain's attractiveness for international property investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Trenger jeg visum for å kjøpe eiendom i Spania?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically to purchase property in Spain. However, non-EU citizens require appropriate visa status for residency. Options include the Non-Lucrative Visa (requiring €27,000 annual income) and the Investment Visa (requiring €500,000 property investment or €1,000,000 capital transfer). EU citizens enjoy unrestricted residency rights throughout Spain. Our specialists provide detailed guidance on visa requirements aligned with individual circumstances."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hvor mye er eiendomsskatten i Spania?",
      "answer": "Årlige eiendomsskatter (Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles) typically represent 0.4-1.1% of the cadastral property value, which often undervalues market value. Transfer tax on property acquisitions ranges from 6-10% depending on the autonomous community (Alicante applies 10%). Capital gains tax applies if the property is sold within specific timeframes. Residents may also be subject to wealth tax depending on total asset holdings and residency status. Professional tax planning optimizes overall cost structures for international property owners."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jeg få boliglån i Spania som utlending?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers can access mortgages from Spanish banks and international lenders, though loan-to-value ratios typically cap at 60-80% of property value. Most lenders require NIE (Spanish tax identification) and proof of income. Interest rates are currently competitive compared to UK markets. Many international buyers combine Spanish mortgages with home-country financing to optimize overall capital structures. Our financial specialists coordinate mortgage arrangements aligned with individual buyer profiles and circumstances."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hva er levekostnadene på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Cost of living in Costa Blanca is approximately 20-30% lower than UK equivalents, with particular savings evident in dining, entertainment, and utilities. Grocery costs reflect Mediterranean agricultural productivity; restaurant meals range from €10-30 for quality establishments. Utilities (electricity, water, gas) average €100-150 monthly for a 3-bedroom villa. Healthcare costs are significantly reduced through Spanish national insurance or affordable private coverage. These economics enable comfortable, sophisticated lifestyles at substantially lower total expenditure than northern European alternatives."
    },
    {
      "question": "Er Costa Blanca bra for pensjonister?",
      "answer": "Yes, Costa Blanca is exceptional for retirement, with established international senior communities, excellent healthcare access, favorable climate, and cost-effective living standards. The Non-Lucrative Visa specifically accommodates retirees with €27,000 annual income requirements. Healthcare quality exceeds many home-country standards while costing substantially less. Social infrastructure, including expat groups, cultural activities, and recreational facilities, combats retirement isolation. The established English-speaking community and modern amenities ensure comfortable transitions for international retirees."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hvordan er været på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys Mediterranean climate with approximately 300 days of sunshine annually, winter temperatures averaging 12°C, and summer highs around 28°C.

The climate enables year-round outdoor activities—swimming, golf, and boating—without seasonal constraints of northern climates.
