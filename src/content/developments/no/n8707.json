The town of approximately 6,000 residents enjoys a privileged Mediterranean climate: 300+ days of annual sunshine, mild winters averaging 15°C, and warm summers perfectly tempered by sea breezes. Lo Monte neighborhood sits slightly inland, offering peaceful residential charm without coastal overdevelopment, yet remains just minutes from sandy beaches and the vibrant marina.\n\nThe area's geography provides natural appeal—the dramatic Sierra del Oro mountain range creates a scenic backdrop, while proximity to the Guardamar Dunes Natural Park offers nature lovers endless walking trails. The region has transformed over two decades into a mature, well-established community rather than a transient tourist zone. Local Spanish culture remains intact while international residents have contributed excellent schools, quality restaurants, and professional services.",

Supermarkets like Mercadona and Lidl provide familiar brands alongside Spanish products. The pace is genuinely relaxed—no rush, no pressure—yet everything you need sits within arm's reach.
