  "metaDescription": "2-bedroom bungalow at La Finca Golf, Algorfa. €325,000. Premium build, 74m², golf lifestyle. 50% less than coastal towns.",
  "heroIntro": "Welcome to La Finca Golf in Algorfa, where your golf lifestyle meets exceptional value. This 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom bungalow offers the perfect base for golfers seeking year-round championship courses without the inflated coastal town prices. Priced at €325,000—50% less than comparable properties in beachfront communities—this property delivers premium specification and direct access to one of Spain's most respected golf communities. La Finca Golf isn't just a residential address; it's a members' lifestyle. Wake to fairway views, spend afternoons refining your swing on the championship course, and unwind at the clubhouse with fellow enthusiasts from across Europe. At €4,392 per square meter, you're investing in a property that combines modern comfort with golf culture, set in the heart of the Costa Blanca's most authentic inland experience. With the market trending upward at 12% year-on-year, this represents both immediate lifestyle gratification and solid investment potential.",
  "areaSection": "Algorfa sits in the heart of inland Alicante, just 15 minutes from the Mediterranean beaches and perfectly positioned between Torrevieja and Guardamar. This is authentic Costa Blanca—away from the tourist sprawl but never isolated. The village enjoys the region's reliable year-round climate: 320+ days of sunshine, mild winters averaging 15°C, and warm summers perfect for golf. Algorfa has evolved from agricultural roots into a vibrant residential hub, attracting a sophisticated international community drawn by golf, value, and genuine Spanish character. The surrounding countryside rolls gently through orange groves and market gardens, creating a peaceful environment that still connects easily to urban amenities. Unlike coastal developments where construction spiraled into concrete monotony, Algorfa maintains village charm while offering modern infrastructure. The area benefits from Torrevieja's extensive services and the quieter pace preferred by experienced expats.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Life in Algorfa centers on community and outdoor pursuits. Golf enthusiasts form the beating heart of the social scene—La Finca Golf hosts regular tournaments, club events, and the famous 19th hole gatherings where relationships deepen over drinks. Beyond golf, your week includes beach trips to Guardamar or La Mata (15-20 minutes), exploring weekly markets brimming with local produce, and dining at the growing selection of restaurants catering to international tastes. English is widely spoken at La Finca and throughout the expat community, eliminating isolation concerns. Shopping is convenient: Mercadona supermarket in nearby Rojales, major centers in Torrevieja for everything else. The expat demographic skews affluent and active—professionals, retired executives, and serious golfers who value substance over nightlife. You'll find international clubs, church services in English, and a genuine sense of belonging. Healthcare access rivals Spain's best, with modern facilities minutes away. This isn't a party destination; it's a lifestyle community for those seeking balance between outdoor pursuits, social connection, and authentic Spanish living.",
  "investmentSection": "This property stands in a market experiencing significant momentum. Costa Blanca residential prices climbed 12% year-on-year, yet Algorfa remains considerably undervalued compared to coastal alternatives. At €325,000, you're acquiring an asset in a proven community with demonstrated demand. The rental market validates this: comparable 2-bedroom bungalows at La Finca command €900 per week during peak seasons (June-September), translating to €45,000+ annually from 6-month lets. Owner-occupiers report strong occupancy through international golf rental platforms. Conservative estimates: 40% annual occupancy yields €18,000 net income, recovering your investment in 18 years while building equity. Long-term buyers benefit further: golf tourism to Spain continues growing, property values in established courses appreciate steadily, and Algorfa's transformation into a lifestyle destination supports sustained demand. Unlike speculative coastal developments, La Finca has 25+ years of operational history and proven resident satisfaction.",
  "conclusion": "This 2-bedroom bungalow at La Finca Golf represents more than property acquisition—it's a lifestyle investment for serious golfers and discerning expats. At €325,000, you're acquiring direct golf access, international community, and year-round Mediterranean living at 50% of coastal town prices. With demonstrated 12% annual appreciation and €18,000+ annual rental income potential, the investment fundamentals are solid. But honestly, most buyers report the golf lifestyle and community value outweigh financial returns. You wake to Spanish sunshine, breakfast overlooking fairways, play a championship course by 9 am, and spend afternoons with accomplished individuals who share your passion. That's not easily quantified. Ready to explore? Contact us via WhatsApp for virtual tours, market data, and personalized property guidance. We represent serious buyers across Europe.",

This justifies premium pricing and supports strong rental returns through international golf tourism."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does property pricing compare to coastal towns?",
      "answer": "This property at €4,392/m² costs 50% less than equivalent properties in Benidorm, Alicante, or beachfront towns where comparable bungalows command €8,000-10,000/m². You're investing €325,000 for a property that would cost €450,000-500,000 on the coast. This represents exceptional value, particularly considering La Finca Golf's amenities and the international golf community's proven demand for inland courses over congested beaches."
