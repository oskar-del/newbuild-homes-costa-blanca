  "metaDescription": "Modern 61m² apartment near El Cura Beach. Prime Torrevieja location, new build, easy beach access. Investment opportunity in popular coastal area.",
  "heroIntro": "This 61-square-meter apartment represents a smart acquisition in one of Costa Blanca's most sought-after beachfront developments. Located just 250 meters from Playa de El Cura, arguably Torrevieja's most celebrated beach, the property sits within a thoughtfully designed 17-unit building that balances modern comfort with Mediterranean accessibility. The area around El Cura Beach has undergone significant investment in recent years, transforming it into a vibrant hub where locals and visitors converge year-round, making this particular location exceptionally appealing for both owner-occupiers and investment-minded buyers.\n\nTorrevieja itself is experiencing a renaissance. Once primarily known as a salt-mining town, it has evolved into a major tourist and residential destination, with a permanent population of around 100,000 that swells considerably during peak season. The promenade stretching along the coastline offers restaurants, beach bars, and cultural venues that give the town genuine character beyond typical Costa Blanca stereotypes. El Cura Beach specifically provides a more sheltered bathing experience compared to some exposed areas, and the nearby paseo marítimo has become a hub for evening strolls, outdoor dining, and social activity.\n\nThis new-build apartment comes at an opportune moment in Torrevieja's development cycle. The town has invested heavily in infrastructure improvements, public spaces, and municipal services, while maintaining lower property costs than neighboring destinations like Benidorm or Jávea. The building itself follows contemporary architectural standards with proper insulation, modern utilities, and sensible layouts designed for year-round comfort rather than cramped seasonal rentals.",

    "intro": "El Cura Beach sits in central Torrevieja, offering residents the rare combination of genuine beach living with established town infrastructure. The neighborhood has matured considerably over the past decade, with serious investment in municipal services, parking, and public amenities. Unlike some overdeveloped beach strips, this area maintains a working-community feel alongside tourism, meaning you'll find everyday services alongside hospitality businesses. The paseo marítimo is pedestrianized and well-maintained, creating a genuinely walkable environment where you can access most essentials without a car.\n\nTorrevieja's broader setting adds substantial value to any beachfront property here. The town sits roughly 50 kilometers south of Alicante Airport, making it accessible but far enough to avoid proximity noise and congestion. The Mediterranean climate provides roughly 300 days of annual sunshine, while the town's strategic location between Valencia and the Murcia region gives it natural commercial importance that supports stable property values.",

  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja has demonstrated consistent rental demand across both seasonal and year-round segments. Summer tourism drives high nightly rates, particularly in July and August, while the growing community of extended-stay visitors and digital nomads creates steady mid-season occupancy. A 61-square-meter one-bedroom apartment offers flexibility—it functions well as a vacation rental targeting couples and solo travelers, or as a long-term rental for professionals seeking temporary accommodation. The El Cura Beach location specifically benefits from its reputation as one of the area's premium bathing spots, driving consistent visitor interest.\n\nTorrevieja's demographic trends support continued property demand. The town attracts both northern European retirees seeking permanent winter residency and younger professionals drawn by improving services and lower costs than more saturated alternatives. Infrastructure improvements, including recent upgrades to public transport connections and commercial facilities, suggest the municipality is committed to attracting quality residents rather than purely seasonal tourism. For investors, this translates to a market less vulnerable to shifts in budget travel patterns, as the underlying residential demand continues strengthening.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What makes El Cura Beach different from other Torrevieja beaches?",
      "answer": "El Cura Beach offers a more protected, sheltered bathing environment compared to some of Torrevieja's exposed coastal areas. It's historically been the town's most popular swimming spot, with better facilities and a more established social atmosphere along the paseo marítimo. The name comes from a local legend, giving it distinctive character and long-standing reputation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Torrevieja a viable year-round residence or mainly seasonal tourism?",
      "answer": "Torrevieja functions as both. The permanent population has grown significantly, and the town now supports year-round services, schools, and professional opportunities. While summer tourism peaks dramatically, the broader area has developed genuine residential infrastructure making permanent living entirely practical and increasingly popular among EU retirees and remote workers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What rental income can realistically be expected from a one-bedroom apartment?",
      "answer": "Summer nightly rates for beachfront one-bedrooms in Torrevieja typically range from €60-90 depending on specific amenities and season timing. Year-round monthly rental rates average €700-900. Actual income depends on your personal management approach, marketing effectiveness, and whether you target short-term tourism or longer-term residential tenants. Many owners blend both approaches seasonally."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do property taxes and ownership costs work for foreign buyers in Spain?",
      "answer": "Foreign EU and non-EU citizens can purchase Spanish property with the same rights as Spanish nationals. Annual property taxes are generally modest (typically €50-150 annually for a property this size), though Spanish residency creates tax obligations beyond property ownership. Professional legal counsel during purchase is essential to understand your specific tax situation and complete necessary registrations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the general appreciation outlook for Torrevieja properties?",
      "answer": "Torrevieja has shown stable to moderate appreciation over the past decade, averaging roughly 2-4% annually. This reflects the town's genuine demand drivers and improving infrastructure rather than speculative bubbles. Properties in prime beach-adjacent locations like this apartment typically appreciate slightly faster than inland alternatives, though all real estate carries market risk."
    },
    {
      "question": "How feasible is it to personally manage rentals if I live elsewhere?",
      "answer": "Many property owners use professional management companies in Torrevieja, typically charging 15-20% of rental income for complete handling of bookings, guest communication, cleaning, maintenance, and key exchange. This removes operational complexity but reduces net income. Alternatively, numerous owners manage remotely using digital calendars and booking platforms, requiring more personal attention but higher profit retention."
