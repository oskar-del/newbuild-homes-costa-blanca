      "question": "Czy obcokrajowcy mogą kupić nieruchomość w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "Yes. UK and EU citizens can purchase Spanish property freely without residency requirements or work permits. Non-EU buyers may purchase property but require a Spanish NIE (tax identification number), obtainable through your lawyer or local authorities.

    },
    {
      "question": "Jakie są koszty zakupu nieruchomości w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect 6-10% additional costs: 6-7% transfer tax (ITP), 1-2% notary and registry fees, plus lawyer fees (0.5-1%). For this €425,000 property, total acquisition costs would approximately €25,500-42,500. These figures vary by region; Murcia's transfer tax of 6% is favorable compared to other Spanish regions."

Interest rates are competitive (currently 3-4%), and many lenders provide English-language support. UK buyers often maintain UK mortgages or use Spanish financing; your lawyer can recommend reputable lenders experienced with international clients."

Warm year-round climate eliminates heating costs; excellent public healthcare at nominal fees; affordable living; established English-speaking expat community; and abundant cultural/recreational activities (golf, beach clubs, markets, restaurants). Many UK retirees find Costa Blanca offers superior quality of life compared to UK retirement at lower cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much rental income can I expect from this property?",
      "answer": "€800-950 weekly during peak season (June-September), generating €12,000-15,000 for a 4-month summer season. Off-season rates are €500-700 weekly. Conservative annual projections suggest €15,000-18,000 rental income, offsetting ownership costs and delivering strong return on investment. Short-term rental platforms (Airbnb, Vrbo) make management straightforward even while living abroad."
