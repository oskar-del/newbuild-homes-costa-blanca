  "areaSection": "Los Alcazares sits on the Mar Menor coast of Murcia, a region that has undergone sophisticated development while retaining its authentic Spanish character. The town occupies a strategic position between Cartagena's historic port and the salt marshes that have defined this landscape for centuries. The climate is Mediterranean with Continental influences—warm, dry summers averaging 28°C, and mild winters rarely dropping below 10°C. The Mar Menor itself, a shallow lagoon separated from the Mediterranean by a natural barrier, creates unique microclimatic conditions that appeal to those seeking health benefits from mineral-rich waters. Unlike the overdeveloped coastal areas further north, Los Alcazares maintains a measured pace of growth, attracting professionals and retirees who value substance over spectacle.",

Mornings might begin with a coffee at a beachfront café overlooking the Mar Menor, while afternoons accommodate championship golf at nearby courses or cultural excursions to Cartagena's historic quarter. The town supports quality supermarkets including Mercadona and regional markets, ensuring access to both international brands and local specialties. Healthcare is world-class, with English-speaking doctors readily available and regional hospitals within 30 minutes. The established infrastructure means expat residents enjoy the benefits of a community without isolation—restaurants, social clubs, and cultural events cater specifically to international demographics without sacrificing Spanish authenticity.",
  "investmentSection": "This property commands premium positioning within the Los Alcazares market, where the average price per square meter stands at €2,200 versus this property's €3,437—a 56% premium justified by contemporary construction quality and Serena Golf location.
