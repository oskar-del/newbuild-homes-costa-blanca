Located in Alicante province, this well-established residential area benefits from a Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of annual sunshine, making it ideal for those seeking to escape harsher winters. The town has developed organically around the needs of international residents, with infrastructure, amenities, and services tailored to English-speaking communities. Unlike overcrowded coastal developments, Ciudad Quesada maintains a genuine sense of place while offering all modern conveniences. The surrounding region features dramatic mountain scenery, pine forests, and easy access to both beaches and cultural attractions. This balance—between authentic Spanish culture and international comfort—is what attracts retirees looking for substance rather than superficial tourism.",
