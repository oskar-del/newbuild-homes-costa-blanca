  "heroIntro": "This 1-bedroom apartment in Avileses represents a compelling investment opportunity in one of Costa Blanca's most undervalued markets. Priced at €78,000—19% below the Avileses average of €2,200/m²—the property offers significant capital appreciation potential in a region experiencing consistent 8% year-on-year growth. The compact 44m² layout is ideally suited for holiday let income, with comparable properties in the area generating approximately €800 per week during peak season. Located in the Murcia region of Costa Blanca, this apartment combines affordability with strong rental demand, making it an attractive entry point for investors seeking regular income streams without the premium pricing of beachfront markets. The established international community ensures steady tourism and rental inquiries, while the property's price point places it 40% below equivalent investments in major Spanish island markets.

Unlike premium Costa Blanca locations, this property avoids the saturated market dynamics of Benidorm or Torrevieja, offering genuine supply-demand balance. The compact size appeals to cost-conscious holiday renters and young professionals, maximizing occupancy rates. Investors benefit from straightforward management, lower maintenance costs, and the financial flexibility that sub-€80k properties provide.",
