  "areaSection": "San Miguel de Salinas sits in the southern Costa Blanca, nestled between the coastal resorts and inland rural Spain. This pueblo town maintains authentic Spanish character while accommodating a thriving international community. The location offers the best of both worlds: you're just 20 minutes from multiple Blue Flag beaches and vibrant coastal towns, yet you've retained the peaceful, unhurried pace of village life. The area benefits from year-round sunshine—over 300 days annually—with mild winters making it ideal for those escaping harsh northern climates. The town has developed excellent infrastructure over recent years, with modern healthcare facilities, reliable utilities, and good road connections to larger centers. The landscape is marked by citrus groves and agricultural character, creating a genuinely Mediterranean atmosphere without the overdevelopment of busier coastal areas.",

Healthcare is straightforward with English-speaking doctors readily available at private clinics, plus a regional hospital just 30 minutes away for specialist needs. Restaurants range from casual Spanish tapas bars to international cuisine, reflecting the diverse community. The beaches are close enough for regular visits yet far enough that you're not caught in tourist crowds.

  "investmentSection": "Beyond serving as your personal retirement home, this apartment offers solid investment fundamentals.

Many retirees use this strategy: live in the property for 6-7 months, rent it to holiday makers during peak season, and enjoy steady income that offsets ownership costs. The expat community creates consistent demand from peers seeking winter rentals or holiday escapes, providing a ready market beyond traditional tourism.",
