    {
      "question": "Czy obcokrajowcy mogą kupić nieruchomość w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners can purchase property in Spain with minimal restrictions. Non-residents pay a slightly higher capital gains tax, but purchase processes are straightforward with proper legal representation. Many British families own properties in Costa Blanca through personal ownership, companies, or trusts depending on their tax circumstances. Your solicitor can guide optimal purchase structures for your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jakie są koszty zakupu nieruchomości w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "Total purchase costs typically amount to 8-10% of the property price, including: transfer tax (3-8% depending on region), notary fees (0.5-1%), land registry fees (0.1%), and solicitor costs (1-2%). For this €459,000 property, expect total acquisition costs of approximately €36,000-€45,000. Spanish properties have no survey requirement, reducing costs compared to UK purchases."
    },
    {
      "question": "Czy mogę uzyskać kredyt hipoteczny w Hiszpanii jako obcokrajowiec?",
      "answer": "Many Spanish banks offer mortgages to foreign buyers, typically lending 60-80% of property value to EU citizens with stable income. Interest rates are competitive with UK mortgages. Non-EU buyers may face stricter requirements but mortgages are achievable with proper documentation. Spanish mortgages often have fixed-rate options and flexible terms. Most international buyers work with English-speaking mortgage advisors who navigate the process efficiently."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jakie są koszty życia na Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca's cost of living is approximately 25-30% lower than southeastern England. Groceries, utilities, and dining out are cheaper, though imported UK products cost more. Annual household costs for a family of four typically range €18,000-€24,000 excluding mortgage payments. Healthcare through public system is free for residents; private insurance costs €100-200 monthly. The region's affordability enables families to enjoy higher living standards than equivalent UK budgets."
    },
    {
      "question": "Czy Costa Blanca jest dobra dla emerytów?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is excellent for retirees, with established communities, affordable healthcare, warm climate year-round, and active social networks. However, this particular property (modern 3-bed family villa) suits younger families better than retirees. Retirement properties typically prefer single-story layouts or apartments requiring less maintenance. For retirees, La Marina offers safety, healthcare access, and affordability—making it increasingly popular with UK pensioners."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jaka jest pogoda na Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of annual sunshine, temperatures averaging 18°C in winter and 28°C in summer. Rainfall is minimal (200-300mm yearly) concentrated in autumn. Winters rarely freeze; summers remain pleasant due to sea breezes. This 3-bedroom villa's south-facing orientation and modern insulation maximize comfort year-round. Families appreciate being able to enjoy outdoor activities and beach visits almost daily throughout the year."
    },
    {
      "question": "Czy potrzebuję wizy, żeby kupić nieruchomość w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "UK citizens don't require a visa to purchase property in Spain. Property investment is separate from residency status. However, if you plan to spend more than 90 days yearly, you may want to register for Spanish residency (especially with mortgage in place), which involves minimal paperwork. Many British property owners maintain UK residency while owning Spanish homes. Your solicitor can advise on optimal residency approaches for your circumstances."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there good rental potential for this villa?",
      "answer": "Yes, excellent rental potential exists. Similar properties in La Marina achieve €800+ weekly rates during summer months. With minimal marketing, families can realistically rent 16-20 weeks annually, generating €12,800-€16,000 income. Off-season rates (€500-600 weekly) appeal to couples and small groups. The established tourist infrastructure, beach proximity, and international airport access make this villa attractive to holiday renters seeking authentic Mediterranean living with modern comforts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why choose La Marina over other Costa Blanca locations?",
      "answer": "La Marina offers the optimal balance between beachside living and affordability. Unlike crowded tourist areas, it maintains a genuine community feel while remaining only 20 minutes from Blue Flag beaches. Property prices are reasonable (€2,200/m² average) compared to Benidorm or coastal hotspots, yet the infrastructure is modern and reliable. The established international community provides support networks essential for families relocating from abroad. It's increasingly popular with young families specifically because it delivers authentic Spanish living without compromising on schools, healthcare, or safety."
