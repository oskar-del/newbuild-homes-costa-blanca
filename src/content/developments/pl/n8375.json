Geographically situated 45km south of Alicante, San Pedro del Pinatar has evolved from a fishing village into a thriving coastal community while retaining authentic Spanish character. The area's natural assets—pristine beaches, protected salt marshes, and marine reserves—have positioned it as an emerging destination for both holiday tourism and permanent relocation. Unlike overcrowded Costa del Sol hotspots, San Pedro del Pinatar maintains a balanced community atmosphere with genuine local culture, making it attractive to investors seeking properties in less saturated, high-growth markets.",
