  "areaSection": "Teulada is a charming inland municipality in the Marina Baixa region of Alicante, positioned strategically between the Mediterranean coast and the inland mountains of Costa Blanca. This whitewashed village retains authentic Valencian character while benefiting from excellent infrastructure and proximity to major amenities. The microclimate is Mediterranean subtropical, with over 300 days of sunshine annually and temperatures that remain mild throughout winter—ideal for year-round residency. Teulada's elevation provides natural cooling breezes during summer months, while the surrounding countryside features olive groves, almond trees, and pine forests that create a serene rural atmosphere. The municipality has experienced measured development that respects the local landscape, attracting a sophisticated blend of Spanish families and international residents who value authentic community living over resort-style development.",
