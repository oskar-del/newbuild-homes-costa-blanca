    },
    {
      "question": "Czy obcokrajowcy mogą kupić nieruchomość w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Non-EU and EU citizens can purchase Spanish property without citizenship restrictions. The process requires opening a Spanish bank account, obtaining a fiscal identification number (NIE), and engaging a Spanish solicitor—straightforward procedures that typically complete within 6-8 weeks.

    },
    {
      "question": "Jakie są koszty zakupu nieruchomości w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect acquisition costs of approximately 10-12% total: 6-8% transfer tax (ITP), 1.5% notary and registry fees, and 3% legal/administration costs. For non-residents, different tax implications apply—though these are still reasonable compared to UK stamp duty structures. Roczne podatki od nieruchomości (IBI) typically represent 0.4-0.6% of property value, significantly lower than comparable UK council taxes."
    },

      "answer": "Yes. Major Spanish banks and international mortgage specialists readily finance foreign buyers, typically offering 70-80% loan-to-value at competitive interest rates (currently 3-4%). Spanish mortgages require Spanish tax residency, but this is easily established. Many UK buyers combine Spanish mortgages with UK equity release, creating tax-efficient financing structures. Your solicitor can guide optimal arrangements based on personal circumstances."

      "question": "Jakie są koszty życia na Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca cost of living is approximately 30-40% lower than comparable UK areas.

    },
    {
      "question": "Czy Costa Blanca jest dobra dla emerytów?",
      "answer": "Excellent. Costa Blanca attracts thousands of UK retirees annually due to: superior healthcare accessibility, low cost of living, year-round sunshine (320+ days annually), established English-speaking communities, and world-class leisure amenities. The stable political environment, reliable infrastructure, and international retirement visa programmes make Costa Blanca one of Europe's top retirement destinations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jak daleko jest Costa Blanca od Polski?",
      "answer": "Alicante-Elche Airport is 45 minutes from Rojales, with direct flights to UK regional airports (Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, London) operating daily. Flight times are typically 2.5-3 hours, making weekend visits from UK entirely feasible. Budget airlines offer competitive pricing, enabling holiday home owners to visit multiple times annually without excessive cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jaka jest pogoda na Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys Mediterranean climate with 320+ annual sunshine days, mild winters (averaging 12-15°C), and warm summers (28-32°C). Rainfall is minimal, primarily autumn/spring. This contrasts dramatically with UK grey winters, enabling year-round outdoor activities—swimming, golf, beach walks—without seasonal interruption. The climate supports healthy living and active outdoor lifestyle."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jakie dochody z wynajmu mogę oczekiwać od tej nieruchomości?",
      "answer": "€800-900 per week is realistic for this 2-bedroom bungalow, representing €41,600-46,800 potential annual gross income if rented 52 weeks. Realistic occupancy (70-75%) suggests €29,000-35,000 net annual rental income after maintenance, cleaning, and management costs. This 6-7% yield exceeds most UK buy-to-let returns, with additional capital appreciation potential."
