  "areaSection": "San Miguel de Salinas sits in the heart of the southern Costa Blanca, inland from the famous Orihuela Costa beaches. This geographical position is strategic—close enough to coastal amenities and stunning Blue Flag beaches (within 20 minutes), yet far enough inland to offer genuine Spanish village character and lower property costs. The area benefits from a temperate Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of annual sunshine, making it ideal for those escaping northern European winters. The village itself maintains authentic Spanish charm with local markets, traditional restaurants, and a genuine sense of community. Unlike the more touristy coastal developments, San Miguel de Salinas has evolved into a residential hub for families, retirees, and professionals who value substance over seasonal tourism.",
