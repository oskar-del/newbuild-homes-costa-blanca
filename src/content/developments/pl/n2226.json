  "heroIntro": "Welcome to a peaceful retirement haven on Spain's Costa Blanca. This 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Las Filipinas, Orihuela Costa, offers the relaxed lifestyle you've earned at €255,000 – exceptional value for premium specification that's 35% less expensive than properties in Costa Blanca North. Imagine waking to Mediterranean sunshine, surrounded by a thriving international expat community where English is widely spoken, healthcare is world-class, and the cost of living allows your retirement income to stretch further. This property represents more than just a home; it's your gateway to stress-free living in one of Spain's most desirable retirement destinations. With 65 square meters of thoughtfully designed space, you'll have everything you need without unnecessary complications. The strong British, Scandinavian, and Dutch communities mean instant friendships and familiar support networks. Whether you're seeking golf courses on your doorstep, pristine beaches just minutes away, or simply a place to enjoy peaceful days in guaranteed sunshine, this apartment delivers on every front.",
  "areaSection": "Orihuela Costa sits on the southern edge of the Costa Blanca, in Alicante province, blessed with 320 days of annual sunshine and a Mediterranean climate that feels like eternal spring. This strategic location puts you close enough to Alicante Airport (40 minutes) for easy connections to family and friends, yet far enough from tourist crowds to maintain authentic Spanish village charm. The area has evolved thoughtfully over recent decades, with quality infrastructure and comprehensive services supporting both long-term residents and visitors. Set between natural protection of coastal hills and the sparkling Mediterranean, Orihuela Costa enjoys microclimatic benefits – slightly warmer and more sheltered than areas further north. The terrain slopes gently toward the sea, creating distinctive neighborhoods like Las Filipinas, each with its own character. Golf courses dominate the landscape – this is Spain's golf capital – while Blue Flag beaches provide water activities and relaxation year-round.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Orihuela Costa revolves around unhurried rhythms and genuine community. Your mornings might begin with a coffee at a neighborhood café where locals and expats mix effortlessly – English is genuinely spoken here, removing daily friction many expats fear. Lunchtime often involves a stroll to Mercadona or Consum for fresh produce, then perhaps lunch at one of countless restaurants serving everything from traditional paella to British Sunday roasts. Afternoons are yours: a round at Villamartín Golf Club literally on your doorstep, a beach day at La Zenia or Campoamor, or simply relaxation by your community facilities. The expat infrastructure is mature and genuine – not tourist-focused but practical. English-speaking doctors, British social clubs, Nordic walking groups, and bridge evenings mean you'll never feel isolated. Shopping is convenient with La Zenia Boulevard offering major chains, while weekly markets provide authentic Spanish flavor. Healthcare access ranks among Europe's best, with multiple hospitals within 20 minutes and English-speaking medical staff. This is genuine community living, not manufactured tourism.",

Orihuela Costa properties have appreciated 10% year-on-year over recent years, with this premium specification at €3,923/m² positioned attractively against the area average of €2,100/m².
