  "areaSection": "Benissa occupies a privileged position along Costa Blanca's northern coast, nestled between dramatic limestone cliffs and crystalline Mediterranean waters. This ancient municipality, with roots tracing to the 16th century, seamlessly blends historical character with contemporary affluence. La Fustera, its most prestigious neighborhood, commands elevated terrain offering sweeping open vistas across the Balearic Sea. The microclimate here is notably superior to inland areas: cooling sea breezes moderate summer temperatures while sheltering topography protects from winter's occasional chill. Benissa's geography—with multiple coves and hidden beaches—provides unparalleled coastal access. The region experiences over 300 days of annual sunshine, crystalline visibility extending to Ibiza on clear days, and maintains equilibrium between natural preservation and thoughtful development. This careful balance has earned Benissa distinction as one of Spain's most desirable coastal residential areas, consistently attracting European wealth seeking authentic Mediterranean authenticity rather than mass-tourism experiences.",

Public transport operates efficiently, though most residents prefer personal vehicles for flexibility navigating the picturesque coastal hinterland.",
