  "areaSection": "San Juan de los Terreros sits on Almería's stunning southern coast, a quieter alternative to the busier parts of Costa Blanca. This charming pueblo marinero blends authentic Spanish coastal character with modern family-friendly infrastructure. The area benefits from over 300 days of annual sunshine, with temperatures ranging from mild winters to warm summers—ideal for year-round outdoor living. The town developed originally around fishing and agriculture, maintaining that authentic Mediterranean feel while embracing international residents who've discovered its genuine appeal. Geographically, San Juan de los Terreros sits just 40 minutes south of Almería city and enjoys easy access to Mojácar's acclaimed beaches. The microclimate here is noticeably warmer and drier than further north, with sheltered coves and golden-sand beaches defining the coastline. Unlike more developed resort towns, San Juan de los Terreros retains a relaxed, community-oriented atmosphere where locals and internationals coexist naturally.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in San Juan de los Terreros revolves around beaches, community, and genuine Spanish living costs. Your family will enjoy walking to local markets for fresh produce, gathering at beachfront restaurants where English is widely spoken, and participating in an established international community that makes newcomers feel welcome immediately. The expat population here is significant—British, German, Dutch, and Scandinavian families have created a supportive network without the overcrowding of larger resorts. Schools teach in multiple languages, doctors speak English, and restaurant menus cater to international tastes while maintaining authentic Spanish character. Summer brings beach life: swimming in crystal-clear Mediterranean waters, paddleboarding, and evening paseos along the promenade. Year-round, families enjoy hiking accessible trails, visiting nearby Mojácar for dining and culture, or simply enjoying the slower pace and genuine community connections. Cost of living remains remarkably reasonable compared to UK or Northern Europe—groceries, dining out, and services all represent excellent value.",
  "investmentSection": "San Juan de los Terreros property market is experiencing healthy +8% year-on-year appreciation, driven by international interest and limited new build inventory. At €3,213/m², this villa sits above the local average (€2,200/m²) due to premium specification—but represents remarkable value compared to Balearic island equivalents at €5,300+/m². Family investors appreciate the dual potential: primary residence with school-appropriate location plus summer rental income. Conservative estimates suggest €800/week rental during peak season (June-September), generating €12,800 annually, with shoulder season bookings extending revenue. The location's growing international school presence and healthcare reputation are driving family migration from more expensive areas. Unlike speculative boom-and-bust markets, San Juan de los Terreros appreciates steadily due to fundamental lifestyle appeal and limited property inventory. Smart buyers recognize this offers both lifestyle security (permanent family home) and financial growth (equity appreciation + rental income).",
  "conclusion": "This villa represents the perfect intersection of affordable Mediterranean living and family-practical design. You're not just purchasing 122m² of living space—you're joining an international community where children play safely, schools speak your language, and doctors answer in English. The €391,995 price delivers premium quality at island-market-proof value, with genuine investment appreciation (8% annually) and summer rental income potential.
