    },
    {
      "question": "Why is this Cartagena apartment 40% cheaper than island properties?",
      "answer": "Cartagena is in the emergence phase of the real estate cycle, while Mallorca, Ibiza, and other islands are mature, fully-priced markets.

Cartagena offers identical climate, better value, and stronger +8% annual growth as the market matures—positioning early purchasers to capture significant appreciation before island parity."
