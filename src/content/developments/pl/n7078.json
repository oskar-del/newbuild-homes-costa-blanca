    {
      "question": "Czy obcokrajowcy mogą kupić nieruchomość w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "Yes, non-Spanish citizens can freely purchase Spanish property. UK citizens, EU nationals, and most international buyers face no restrictions. You'll need a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and should engage a gestoría (property management firm) to handle legal requirements.

Investment potential equals coastal areas while maintaining lower entry costs and living expenses. Families report happier experiences in established communities than transient resort environments."
