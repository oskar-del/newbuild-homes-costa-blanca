  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What makes Torrevieja's pink lagoon special and will I really see it from this property?",
      "answer": "Torrevieja's lagoon turns pink due to mineral-rich salt water and specific algae species that create an otherworldly landscape. The color intensifies during summer months. From Los Balcones, residents genuinely experience these views, particularly from upper-floor properties and during optimal light conditions. The phenomenon is not a marketing exaggeration but a documented natural occurrence recognized by environmental scientists."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Los Balcones a good area for retirees and expats?",
      "answer": "Los Balcones has attracted a significant international community, particularly retirees and established expats seeking a balanced Mediterranean lifestyle. The area has developed essential infrastructure: medical services, international grocery options, English-speaking professionals, and established social groups. It maintains authentic Spanish character while offering practical support systems that larger resort areas struggle to provide."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the realistic running costs for this 2-bedroom bungalow?",
      "answer": "Annual costs typically include: community fees (€100-150/month for shared maintenance), property taxes (€150-250/year depending on valuation), electricity (€40-80/month depending on air conditioning usage), water and waste (€30-50/month), and optional comprehensive insurance (€200-400/year). New-build efficiency standards help minimize utilities compared to older properties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I rent this property immediately after purchase?",
      "answer": "Yes, from completion date. Properties in Los Balcones attract consistent rental interest with established agencies managing portfolios in the area. Realistic expectations: long-term rentals (€600-900/month) attract more stable tenants than short-term holiday lets. Some owners combine seasonal rental periods with personal use."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between ground-floor gardens and upper-floor solarium options?",
      "answer": "Ground-floor apartments offer direct garden access, ideal for those with mobility preferences or plant enthusiasts. Upper-floor properties provide elevated lagoon views, solariums for relaxation, and generally better natural ventilation. The choice depends on lifestyle: ground floor suits those prioritizing outdoor gardening; upper floors reward those who value views and elevated entertaining spaces."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the optional third bedroom work in a 69 m² space?",
      "answer": "Developers designed flexibility into the layout, typically allowing conversion of what might be a large living/dining area or den space into a third bedroom. This works well for guest accommodation or home office needs. Visually, it's more practical than cramming a third full-sized bedroom; it creates a functional third space rather than compromising the main living experience."
