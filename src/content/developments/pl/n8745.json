  "areaSection": "San Miguel de Salinas sits in the heart of southern Costa Blanca, just 15 kilometers inland from the glorious beaches of Guardamar and Torrevieja. This pueblo benefits from a genuine Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually, yet avoids the summer extremes of coastal areas. The town itself maintains authentic Spanish character while warmly embracing its substantial international community. Local markets bustle with fresh produce from surrounding agricultural lands, and the pace of life reflects a refreshing reality: people here prioritize wellbeing over hustle. The elevation provides cooling breezes in summer and protection from the worst coastal storms. Unlike overcrowded tourist towns, San Miguel de Salinas offers genuine Spanish authenticity combined with international convenience—a rare and valuable combination for retirees seeking cultural richness without cultural isolation.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in San Miguel de Salinas unfolds at a refreshingly human pace. Morning coffee at a local café, perhaps catching up with neighbors from Germany, Sweden, or the UK, is standard ritual. The weekly market provides fresh vegetables, fish, and conversation. Supermarkets including Mercadona and Lidl serve everyday needs, while Spanish restaurants and international eateries cater to diverse tastes. Healthcare access reassures retirees—the regional hospital is 30 minutes away, and English-speaking private clinics operate throughout the area. The expat community isn't isolating; it's genuinely integrated with Spanish culture. Beaches lie 20 minutes away for swimming or just wandering. Multiple championship golf courses exist within driving distance for those who play. The established international presence means practical support networks: healthcare advice, property management recommendations, and genuine friendships. This is retirement as it should be: freedom to live as you choose, security in knowing help is available, and community surrounding you.",
  "investmentSection": "Beyond personal enjoyment, this property demonstrates solid financial fundamentals. San Miguel de Salinas property prices have appreciated 8% year-on-year, outpacing inflation and contributing to real wealth building. At €2,634/m², this apartment commands a 20% premium over the local average (€2,200/m²), reflecting its quality and condition—yet remains dramatically undervalued compared to island properties. The rental potential shouldn't be overlooked: similar apartments command €800 per week during peak season, generating genuine income if you choose to let it during months abroad. Many retirees find short-term rental of 8-12 weeks annually covers property maintenance costs entirely. Whether as a personal sanctuary or a sensible investment with income potential, this property delivers genuine value in a market offering far better economics than coastal equivalents.",
