Whether you're seeking passive income diversification or a dedicated investment property, this apartment delivers the fundamentals serious investors require: strong location, proven rental demand, and attractive entry pricing.",
  "areaSection": "Finestrat is a picturesque coastal town in Alicante province, perched between the Mediterranean Sea and the Sierra Bernia mountains. The municipality offers a rare combination of authentic Spanish character and modern infrastructure, with a climate featuring 300+ days of annual sunshine. Located just 40 minutes from Alicante International Airport, Finestrat has evolved into a thriving residential hub without losing its genuine Spanish charm. The town's elevation provides natural cooling and spectacular views, while its strategic position on the Costa Blanca makes it equally accessible to both the vibrant Benidorm entertainment scene and quieter, more exclusive beachside communities. The local economy is remarkably diverse, with tourism, agriculture, and residential development creating stable economic fundamentals that support property valuations.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Finestrat centers around Mediterranean rhythms and genuine community connections. The established expat population—primarily British, German, and Scandinavian—has created welcoming social networks, with English widely spoken in restaurants, shops, and healthcare facilities. Beach access is effortless, with multiple Blue Flag beaches within 20 minutes, ideal for weekend breaks that drive holiday rental bookings. Mercadona, Lidl, and Consum supermarkets cater to daily shopping needs, while local weekly markets offer fresh produce at authentic Spanish prices. Healthcare is world-class, with a regional hospital 30 minutes away and private clinics offering English-speaking doctors. The expat-friendly environment means excellent international schools nearby with British curriculum options, making Finestrat particularly attractive for families. Fine dining restaurants, casual tapas bars, and Spanish chiringuitos create a vibrant food scene that appeals directly to holiday renters.",
  "investmentSection": "This property capitalizes on multiple economic tailwinds. Costa Blanca's real estate market has appreciated 8% year-on-year, with Finestrat appreciating faster than regional averages due to infrastructure improvements and tourism growth. At €4,795/m², you're acquiring 40% below Spanish island pricing (Ibiza, Mallorca command €8,000+/m²), creating substantial upside as Finestrat's international profile strengthens. Holiday rental yield projections are substantial: at €800 weekly rates (conservative for premium specifications), annual turnover could reach €35,000+ before costs. With 45-50 weeks of potential bookings annually, this asset generates tangible passive income while building equity through capital appreciation. The 2-bedroom configuration is optimal for holiday lettings—high demand for family groups and friend groups willing to pay premium rates. Professional property management services are readily available locally at competitive rates, enabling truly passive investment with minimal owner involvement.",

Finestrat's infrastructure, established expat community, and beach proximity create genuine competitive advantages for rental portfolios. The 2-bedroom configuration optimally positions this property within the highest-demand holiday rental segment—families and friend groups consistently booking at premium rates. With professional property management readily available locally and English-speaking services throughout the town, this investment requires minimal active owner involvement while generating meaningful passive income.

Winter averages 12-16°C (54-61°F)—mild compared to UK.

      "question": "Ile wynosi podatek od nieruchomości w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "Spain's property tax (Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles - IBI) averages 0.4-1.1% of cadastral value annually, typically €300-600 for properties this size. Capital gains tax applies if you sell within 5 years—currently 19% on gains, declining with ownership duration. Rental income tax is standard income tax (19-45% depending on total income).

    },
    {
      "question": "Czy mogę uzyskać kredyt hipoteczny w Hiszpanii jako obcokrajowiec?",
      "answer": "Foreign buyers can obtain Spanish mortgages, though terms are more restrictive than for Spanish residents. Typical loan-to-value (LTV) ratios are 60-70% for non-residents, requiring 30-40% down payment. Interest rates are competitive: 3-4% for 20-30 year terms. Spanish banks require extensive documentation: proof of income, tax returns, bank statements, and employment verification. Non-EU residents face additional scrutiny. Working with Spanish mortgage brokers (comisionistas hipotecarios) accelerates approval and often secures better rates through lender relationships."
