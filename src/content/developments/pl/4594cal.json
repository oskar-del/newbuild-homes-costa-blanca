  "areaSection": "Javea, nestled on the northernmost point of the Costa Blanca, occupies a distinctive peninsula that projects into the Mediterranean, creating a dramatically different geography from its southern neighbours. The town combines genuine Spanish authenticity with cosmopolitan European sensibilities, distinguished by its three distinct beaches and dramatic rocky coves that characterize the local landscape. The region enjoys over 300 days of annual sunshine with a temperate Mediterranean climate moderated by sea breezes, creating perfect conditions for year-round outdoor living. Javea has maintained its character as a traditional fishing village while modernizing selectively, preserving narrow winding streets and authentic plazas in the old town. The surrounding countryside features pine forests and agricultural land that prevent overdevelopment, maintaining the area's unspoiled character. This unique positioning—close enough to Valencia and Alicante for urban amenities, yet sufficiently remote to preserve tranquility—has attracted a sophisticated international demographic seeking authentic Mediterranean living rather than resort tourism.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Life in Javea revolves around a more measured Mediterranean rhythm that appeals particularly to those seeking an alternative to coastal tourism hubs. The established British, German, and Dutch expatriate communities have created a welcoming environment where international residents seamlessly integrate while maintaining the area's Spanish character.

Healthcare facilities include the modern Hospital de Dénia just 15 minutes away with numerous English-speaking medical professionals, addressing a key concern for international residents. The town supports excellent international schools including Xàbia International College offering British curriculum education, making it particularly attractive for families. Leisure activities span from water sports and coastal walks to golf at Jávea Golf Club, while the established expat infrastructure means finding services, from property maintenance to financial advice, in English. The proximity to Dénia's ferry terminal provides regular connections to Ibiza and Mallorca, enabling weekend escapes without lengthy travel.",

The short-term rental market generates substantial income potential, with comparable properties achieving €1,400 weekly rates during peak season, translating to approximately 18-20% annual gross yields for properties rented 6-7 months annually. Javea distinguishes itself from other Costa Blanca destinations through its preservation of authentic character while maintaining modern amenities, creating sustained appeal across economic cycles.
