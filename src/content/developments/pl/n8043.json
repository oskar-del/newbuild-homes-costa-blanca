  "metaTitle": "2 Sypialni Apartment Denia €315,000 - Okazja Inwestycyjna",
  "metaDescription": "2-bedroom apartment in Denia, Costa Blanca. €315,000. Premium specification, 35% less than Costa Brava. Strong rental income potential.",
  "heroIntro": "This 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment represents a compelling investment opportunity in one of Spain's most resilient coastal markets. Located at Las Marinas km 2.5 in Denia, the property commands €315,000 with premium specifications priced at €4,375/m² - a significant 35% discount compared to comparable Costa Brava properties. For investment-focused buyers, the numbers tell a compelling story: Denia's property market has appreciated 7% year-on-year, while typical holiday lets in this location generate approximately €900 per week in rental income. The 72m² built area combined with 56m² plot space delivers efficient, revenue-generating potential without excess maintenance costs. With 12 high-quality images showcasing the property's condition, this apartment slots perfectly into Denia's thriving short-term rental market, where consistent demand from holiday makers and relocating professionals sustains occupancy rates that significantly outpace broader Spanish averages.",
  "areaSection": "Denia occupies a strategic position on the Costa Blanca, situated 100km north of Alicante and benefiting from both Mediterranean warmth and accessibility. The town's geography - nestled between the Montgo mountain and pristine coastline - creates natural protection while maintaining year-round sunshine averaging 300+ days. Denia's climate balances hot summers (25-30°C) with mild winters (8-15°C), eliminating the extreme heat found further south while avoiding the cooler temperatures of inland regions. The area has historically attracted a cosmopolitan demographic: British, German, Dutch, and French residents comprise a significant expat community where English fluency is standard. This international presence has transformed Denia from a fishing village into a sophisticated coastal destination that retains authentic Spanish character while offering modern European conveniences.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Denia reflects a balanced Mediterranean rhythm increasingly attractive to investors seeking properties with genuine occupancy demand. The expat community ensures excellent English-language services across healthcare, retail, and hospitality sectors. Mornings might include fresh produce shopping at the daily market or weekly supermercados like Mercadona and Carrefour. The waterfront offers five beaches within 5km - Las Marinas, Les Deveses, and La Marineta Casiana provide sandy swimming, while Les Rotes' rocky coves attract divers and photographers. For golf-focused investors, La Sella (10 minutes), Oliva Nova (20 minutes), and Jávea Golf (20 minutes) provide championship courses. The established restaurant and tapas culture caters to both residents and holiday visitors, creating the service infrastructure that supports year-round tourism. Healthcare access through Marina Salud hospital and English-speaking medical centers removes traditional expat concerns, while planned TRAM expansion will further enhance connectivity.",
  "investmentSection": "The investment case for this property anchors on three quantifiable factors. First, Denia's market appreciation at 7% year-on-year significantly outpaces Spanish property averages while remaining below speculative levels - a sustainable growth trajectory. Second, typical weekly rental rates of €900 generate €46,800 annually at 60% occupancy (achievable given Denia's tourist infrastructure), translating to approximately 14.9% gross rental yield before expenses. Third, the €4,375/m² pricing sits 75% above Denia's €2,500/m² average, reflecting premium specification justification while remaining 35% below comparable Costa Brava properties. This premium-yet-discounted positioning creates dual value: higher per-unit rental income through quality appeal, combined with capital appreciation potential as Denia continues market maturation and infrastructure development (including planned TRAM expansion).",
  "conclusion": "This 2-bedroom apartment represents a quantified investment opportunity rather than an aspirational lifestyle purchase. The €315,000 pricing combined with €900/week rental potential, established Denia market infrastructure, and 7% annual appreciation trajectory create the mathematical foundations that serious investors evaluate. With 12 professional images documenting condition, clear title transfer paths for international buyers, and proven rental demand from tourism infrastructure, the property eliminates speculative uncertainty affecting emerging markets. Whether building portfolio diversification, generating European income streams, or establishing Mediterranean capital appreciation positions, this apartment merits detailed financial analysis.
