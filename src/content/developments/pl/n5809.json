  "metaDescription": "Modern 2-bedroom apartment in Playa Flamanca, Orihuela Costa. €325,000. Premium specification, 35% less than North Costa Blanca. Ideal retirement living.",
  "heroIntro": "Welcome to a new chapter of peaceful, relaxed living in Playa Flamenca, where Mediterranean sunshine meets genuine community. This beautifully appointed 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment offers the perfect balance of comfort and value for those seeking a leisurely retirement lifestyle on the Costa Blanca. At €325,000, you're acquiring premium specification at €4,452/m² – remarkably, 35% less than comparable properties in Costa Blanca North – making this an exceptional opportunity for discerning buyers. Playa Flamenca has become a haven for the international expat community, particularly British, Scandinavian, and Dutch retirees who appreciate its relaxed atmosphere, excellent year-round sunshine, and proximity to world-class healthcare facilities. The 73m² layout has been thoughtfully designed for modern living, with two generous bedrooms and two full bathrooms ensuring comfort for you and visiting family. Located in the heart of Orihuela Costa's most sought-after residential area, this property places you within easy reach of golden beaches, championship golf courses, and a vibrant yet peaceful community where English is widely spoken and international residents thrive.",
  "areaSection": "Orihuela Costa represents one of southern Spain's most established and well-developed Mediterranean destinations, stretching along the Alicante coastline between Torrevieja and Guardamar del Segura. This region boasts consistent year-round sunshine with over 300 days of brilliant Mediterranean climate, making it ideal for retirees seeking respite from colder northern climates. The area has matured beautifully over the past two decades, transforming from quiet fishing villages into cosmopolitan communities with world-class infrastructure. Playa Flamenca itself sits at the heart of this development, offering authentic Spanish charm combined with modern European conveniences. The geography is predominantly flat and accessible, with the glittering Mediterranean just minutes away. The region's natural beauty is complemented by carefully maintained green spaces, tree-lined avenues, and thoughtful urban planning that respects the environment whilst providing contemporary living standards. The microclimate here is particularly favourable – slightly warmer and drier than inland areas, yet refreshed by Atlantic breezes that prevent oppressive summer heat.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Orihuela Costa revolves around enjoying the very best of Mediterranean culture at a relaxed pace. Your mornings might begin with a paseo along Playa Flamenca's promenade, followed by café con leche at one of numerous beachfront chiringuitos where English-speaking staff understand exactly what you're after. The international expat community – predominantly British, Dutch, and Scandinavian – has created a wonderfully welcoming environment where you'll find English spoken everywhere, yet authentic Spanish culture remains vibrant. Lunch is taken seriously here; mid-week you might explore family-run restaurants in nearby Orihuela town, or simply enjoy paella at your favourite beach spot. Afternoons offer endless possibilities: a game of golf at nearby Villamartín, shopping at La Zenia Boulevard, or simply relaxing poolside reading whilst the Mediterranean breeze catches your book. The weekly markets in Orihuela provide fresh produce and authentic local colour, and the shopping centres offer everything from international brands to practical necessities. Healthcare access is excellent with English-speaking doctors readily available. Evenings bring a gentle social calendar – dinner clubs, expat meetups, and Spanish cultural events ensure you're never lonely, yet the pace remains refreshingly unhurried.",
  "investmentSection": "Beyond the lifestyle benefits, this property represents solid financial sense. Orihuela Costa has experienced consistent +10% year-on-year price appreciation, reflecting strong underlying demand from retiring professionals and international investors. At €4,452/m², you're acquiring premium specification – comparable to €6,800-7,200/m² in Costa Blanca North – representing exceptional value. The rental market remains robust; similar 2-bedroom properties command €700-900 per week during peak season, translating to €30,000-40,000 annual rental income if you choose to let during months you're away. Many owners successfully balance personal use with income generation, covering running costs whilst maintaining flexibility. The property's location in established Playa Flamenca ensures continued demand from both holiday-makers and long-term residents. With Portugal's Golden Visa programme creating interest from non-EU investors and continued immigration from northern Europe, Orihuela Costa remains one of Spain's most resilient property markets.",
  "conclusion": "This 2-bedroom apartment in Playa Flamenca represents more than property acquisition – it's your gateway to a peaceful, enriched retirement lifestyle in one of Europe's most established Mediterranean communities. At €325,000 with premium specification at 35% discount to comparable North Costa Blanca properties, combined with +10% annual appreciation and strong rental income potential, this is both lifestyle choice and sound investment. The abundance of world-class healthcare, championship golf, beautiful beaches, and thriving international community create the ideal environment for retirees seeking year-round sunshine without compromising modern conveniences. With only 35 professional photographs available and strong interest in this category, we recommend early viewing to fully appreciate this opportunity.
