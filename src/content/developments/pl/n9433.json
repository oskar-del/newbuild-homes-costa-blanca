  "heroIntro": "Escape the ordinary and discover your perfect Mediterranean holiday home in the heart of Dolores, Costa Blanca. This beautifully designed 3-bedroom quad house represents an exceptional opportunity to own a sunshine retreat at just €394,900—remarkably priced 40% below comparable Spanish island markets.

At €3,134/m², this represents premium specification at prices significantly below regional averages, making it an astute investment in one of Spain's most sought-after coastal regions.",
  "areaSection": "Dolores is a charming inland town in the Vega Baja region of Alicante, perfectly positioned between the coast and countryside. This authentic Spanish community offers a genuine blend of local culture and increasing international appeal. The town enjoys the famous Costa Blanca climate—over 300 days of annual sunshine—with mild winters and warm summers ideal for outdoor living. Located just 20 minutes from multiple Blue Flag beaches and close to championship golf courses, Dolores provides the best of both worlds: peaceful, affordable living with easy access to vibrant coastal attractions. The region's growing infrastructure, improving road connections, and strategic location between Alicante city and the Costa Blanca coastline have made it increasingly popular with savvy property buyers seeking authentic Spain without premium coastal pricing.",

  "investmentSection": "Beyond lifestyle, this property makes solid financial sense. Dolores has experienced 8% year-on-year property appreciation, outpacing many European markets. At €394,900, you're purchasing well below regional averages—Dolores averages €2,200/m² while this property sits at €3,134/m², reflecting premium specification rather than premium pricing.
