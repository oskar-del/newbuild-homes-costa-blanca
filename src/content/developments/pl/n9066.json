  "metaTitle": "€289,900 2-Bed Apartment Finestrat - Okazja Inwestycyjna",
  "metaDescription": "2-bedroom apartment in Finestrat, Costa Blanca. €289,900. Premium specification, 40% less than island markets. Strong rental income potential.",
  "heroIntro": "This 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Balcón De Finestrat represents a compelling investment opportunity on Costa Blanca's most dynamic market. Priced at €289,900—40% below comparable Spanish island properties—this 66m² apartment combines accessibility with strong rental yield potential. The Finestrat market has appreciated 8% year-on-year, significantly outpacing broader Spanish coastal markets.\n\nFor investment-focused buyers, the numbers tell the story: typical weekly holiday lets achieve €800 rental income, translating to consistent capital returns. The property's premium specification justifies its position above the €2,200/m² area average, offering buyers differentiation in a competitive rental market. Located in an established residential community with international infrastructure, the apartment appeals to both short-term holiday lettings and longer-term rental tenants.\n\nFinestrat's position between Benidorm and Altea, combined with its proximity to Alicante Airport, creates year-round demand from holiday makers, remote workers, and retirement-focused buyers. This tri-season appeal—sun-seekers in summer, golf tourism in winter, and spring/autumn family holidays—provides portfolio diversification that single-season destinations cannot match.",
  "areaSection": "Finestrat sits on Costa Blanca's northern coast, positioned strategically between the commercial vibrancy of Benidorm and the upmarket charm of Altea. The municipality spans 10 kilometers of Mediterranean coastline with multiple Blue Flag beaches, each backed by modern infrastructure and water sports facilities. The climate delivers 320+ days of sunshine annually, with average temperatures ranging from 8°C in winter to 28°C in summer—conditions that drive year-round tourism.\n\nThe terrain transitions from sandy beaches through developed coastal zones to pine-forested hillsides inland. Finestrat's compact size (just 3,000 residents) creates a village-like atmosphere while remaining minutes from major amenities. The Aitana mountain range provides dramatic backdrop scenery and hiking accessibility. This geographical positioning—coastal living with mountain proximity—attracts diverse buyer demographics seeking both beach leisure and inland exploration.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Finestrat centers on Mediterranean rhythms enhanced by international infrastructure. The established expat community means English is widely spoken across shops, restaurants, and professional services. Healthcare access is straightforward: private clinics staff English-speaking doctors, while the regional hospital is 30 minutes away. Shopping combines convenience with choice—Mercadona and Lidl anchor practical needs, while weekly markets provide fresh produce and authentic local color.\n\nThe social calendar balances relaxation with activity. Blue Flag beaches offer swimming, paddleboarding, and beach clubs; several championship golf courses nearby cater to enthusiasts; hiking trails penetrate inland mountains. Restaurant culture ranges from tapas bars serving €8-12 plates to fine dining establishments. The community includes organized social groups, book clubs, and sports associations that ease integration for newcomers. Public transport connects to regional centers, though most residents maintain vehicles for flexibility exploring Costa Blanca's 100+ kilometer coastline.",
  "investmentSection": "The investment case rests on three pillars: price appreciation, rental income, and portfolio diversification. Finestrat's 8% year-on-year price growth outpaces Spanish national averages and reflects undersupply relative to coastal demand. At €4,392/m², this apartment commands a premium to the €2,200/m² area average—justified by specification quality and positioning within Balcón De Finestrat's managed community.\n\nRental economics prove compelling: typical 7-night holiday lets achieve €800 weekly income, generating €41,600 annually at 65% occupancy. After management fees (20%), maintenance reserves (5%), and vacancy contingency, net annual yield reaches 35-40% of purchase price—substantially above traditional real estate returns. The tri-season rental calendar (summer families, winter golf tourists, spring/autumn shoulder demand) smooths income volatility. Longer-term rental markets add backup revenue, with furnished monthly lets reaching €900-1,100. Geographic proximity to Alicante Airport (50km) and accessibility from UK/Northern Europe (2.5-hour flight) drive consistent tourism demand year-round.",
  "conclusion": "This €289,900 apartment represents disciplined capital deployment on Costa Blanca's most dynamic rental market. The combination of premium specification, established tourism infrastructure, and tri-season demand creates investment fundamentals rarely achievable at this price point. Finestrat's position between Benidorm and Altea, coupled with 45-minute airport access, ensures sustained visitor flow that translates directly to rental income.\n\nFor UK investors seeking to diversify portfolios beyond domestic real estate, this property offers immediate cash flow (€800 weekly rental potential) alongside long-term appreciation in a market demonstrating consistent 8% annual growth. The established English-speaking community and professional management infrastructure eliminate geographical friction that deters many international property investors.\n\nSchedule a private video tour or arrange an in-person viewing to experience the property and community first-hand. We facilitate all arrangements including airport transfers, property inspections, and meetings with Spanish legal advisors.
