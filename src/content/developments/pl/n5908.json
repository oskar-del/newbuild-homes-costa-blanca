  "metaTitle": "€995k 4-Bed Villa Campoamor Orihuela Costa Spain",
  "metaDescription": "Ekskluzywny 4-bedroom villa in prestigious Campoamor, Orihuela Costa. Premium build, 500m² plot. 35% less than Costa Blanca Północ.",
  "heroIntro": "This exceptional 4-bedroom villa represents a sophisticated investment opportunity in one of Spain's most discerning coastal communities. Located in the exclusive Campoamor district of Orihuela Costa, this premium residence showcases refined architectural design across 157m² of carefully appointed living space, set on a generous 500m² private plot. Priced at €995,000, this property exemplifies outstanding value within the luxury segment—commanding a premium specification yet positioned 35% below equivalent properties in Costa Blanca's northern regions. The villa caters to discerning buyers seeking both personal sanctuary and investment potential, with the area experiencing consistent year-on-year appreciation of 10% and strong seasonal rental demand averaging €800 per week. Orihuela Costa has established itself as the preferred address for affluent expatriates and international buyers who demand privacy, quality, and proximity to world-class amenities without the overcrowded tourist atmosphere of less exclusive coastal developments.",
  "areaSection": "Campoamor is the jewel of Orihuela Costa, a prestigious residential enclave positioned along the Costa Blanca's most coveted stretch. Situated approximately 60 kilometers south of Alicante, this Mediterranean microclimate enjoys over 320 days of annual sunshine and average temperatures of 18°C in winter and 28°C in summer. The area is defined by its mature landscaping, low-density development philosophy, and strong architectural standards that preserve the region's upscale character. Campoamor benefits from proximity to pristine beaches including La Zenia (Blue Flag certified), Cabo Roig, and the discrete Playa Flamenca—each offering distinct personalities from family-friendly to more exclusive settings. The surrounding countryside features rolling terrain with distant sea views, golf courses integrated seamlessly into the landscape, and Mediterranean pine forests that provide natural privacy and cooling. Unlike the overdeveloped north, Campoamor maintains strict building regulations and limited commercial density, preserving genuine tranquility.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Campoamor means access to an international community of accomplished professionals, entrepreneurs, and retirees who have deliberately chosen this destination. The strong expatriate population—particularly from Britain, Scandinavia, and the Netherlands—has created an ecosystem where English is widely spoken and international standards are maintained across healthcare, education, and services. Daily life centers on exceptional infrastructure: world-class golf courses like Villamartín sit virtually on the doorstep, offering championship-level play; La Zenia Boulevard provides comprehensive shopping with international brands and fine dining; and the Spanish lifestyle remains authentically present through weekly markets, local tapas bars, and established community events. Healthcare is exceptionally well-served with English-speaking medical professionals and modern facilities minutes away. The area cultivates a refined but unpretentious atmosphere—this is where successful individuals live, not where tourists visit. The beach lifestyle is accessible yet never intrusive, allowing residents to maintain dignity and privacy while enjoying Mediterranean outdoor living.",
  "investmentSection": "This property represents a strategically positioned investment within a market demonstrating measurable appreciation. Orihuela Costa has experienced consistent 10% year-on-year price growth, outperforming broader Spanish real estate markets and maintaining resilience through economic cycles. The villa's premium specification at €6,338/m² positions it advantageously below comparable properties in Costa Blanca's northern regions (typically €9,700/m² or higher), while exceeding the local average of €2,100/m² due to superior construction standards and location within Campoamor's exclusive sector. Rental income represents a secondary revenue stream: comparable properties generate €800+ weekly during peak season (June-September), with extended shoulder seasons (April-May, October-November) providing 60-70% occupancy at competitive rates. The four-bedroom configuration appeals to family groups and corporate retreats, commanding premium nightly rates. Long-term ownership appreciation, coupled with seasonal rental generation and the lifestyle benefits of Mediterranean residence, creates a comprehensive investment thesis beyond traditional real estate speculation.",
  "conclusion": "This villa represents a refined opportunity for discerning buyers seeking authentic Mediterranean residence combined with intelligent investment positioning. The €995,000 price point, premium construction standards, and location within prestigious Campoamor provide compelling value within the luxury market segment. Orihuela Costa's established international community, exceptional infrastructure, and consistent appreciation trajectory appeal to those prioritizing lifestyle quality and financial prudence equally. Whether as a personal sanctuary for year-round residence, seasonal base for family holidays, or part-time income-generating property, this villa delivers sophistication without compromise. The genuine scarcity of comparable opportunities at this price point suggests limited availability.
