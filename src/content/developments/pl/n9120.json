    {
      "question": "Is Daya Nueva a safe neighborhood?",

    {
      "question": "Jaka jest pogoda na Costa Blanca?",

Light clothing is necessary year-round."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far is the nearest beach from this property?",
      "answer": "Blue Flag beaches are approximately 18-20 minutes by car. Playa Paraíso and Playa Centro are the nearest quality beaches. The village's slightly inland location (200m elevation) avoids excessive summer heat while keeping the coast conveniently accessible for family beach days, water sports, and evening sunset trips."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I rent out this property to generate income?",
      "answer": "Yes, this villa is ideal for rental income. Similar 3-bedroom properties in Daya Nueva typically rent for €800/week to families and holiday visitors. At moderate occupancy (40-50 weeks annually), you could generate €30,000-40,000 yearly. This can offset your costs or provide investment returns. Many families use this strategy to make their Spanish home financially self-supporting."
