The area benefits from over 300 days of annual sunshine and a temperate Mediterranean climate that makes outdoor living a year-round pleasure.\n\nThe town boasts rich historical roots dating back centuries, visible in its charming architecture and vibrant local culture. Unlike crowded coastal resorts, Orihuela maintains genuine Spanish authenticity while welcoming an established international community. The surrounding region combines agricultural heritage with modern amenities, creating a uniquely appealing setting for those seeking genuine Mediterranean lifestyle rather than tourist-focused developments.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Orihuela flows between relaxation and activity, exactly as you'd hoped. Your mornings might begin with café con leche at a local bar before heading to one of several nearby championship golf courses. Afternoons are flexible: siesta at home, beach time 20 minutes away, or exploring local markets filled with fresh Mediterranean produce.\n\nThe international community here is established and welcoming—English is widely spoken, and you'll find fellow property owners from across Europe and beyond. Healthcare access is excellent with English-speaking doctors and modern private clinics complementing the regional hospital. Shopping ranges from international supermarkets (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum) to authentic local markets offering weekly fresh produce.
