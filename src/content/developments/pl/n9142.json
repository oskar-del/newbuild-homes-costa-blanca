  "heroIntro": "Welcome to a rare opportunity in one of Costa Blanca's most vibrant coastal towns. This stunning modern studio apartment sits in the beating heart of Torrevieja, just a two-minute walk from the Mediterranean Sea. Located in an exclusive boutique development of only 8 newly constructed apartments, this property represents a fresh approach to coastal living—combining the convenience of city-centre location with direct access to beaches and waterfront dining.\n\nTorrevieja has transformed dramatically over recent decades, evolving from a quiet fishing village into a thriving international destination. Today, it balances authentic Spanish charm with modern amenities, attracting both permanent residents and seasonal visitors. This centrally-positioned apartment places you at the nexus of that vitality, where you can enjoy morning beach walks, afternoon tapas at harbourside restaurants, and evening paseos through pedestrianised shopping streets—all within minutes.\n\nWith 31 square metres of intelligently designed space, this studio maximises every corner through contemporary architecture and smart layouts. The development's boutique scale means you'll enjoy exclusivity and community without the anonymity of larger complexes. Whether you're seeking a personal retreat, a holiday base, or an investment property in Spain's most accessible beach market, this apartment delivers genuine lifestyle value.",
  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's rental market has matured into one of Spain's most reliable coastal investment opportunities. The town attracts consistent demand from EU retirees, seasonal holidaymakers, and digital nomads seeking permanent Mediterranean bases. Centre-location properties command premium nightly rates during peak seasons (June-September) when €60-90 per night is achievable for quality studio apartments, and maintain respectable occupancy year-round at €35-50 nightly. Annual gross yields typically range 5-7% for well-positioned units, with potential for higher returns during premium season months.\n\nBeyond holiday lettings, Torrevieja's property market benefits from genuine demographic demand. The UK and Scandinavian communities have established deep roots here, creating stable rental markets for annual lets. Property values in the centre have remained stable or appreciated modestly over recent years, suggesting you're entering at a rational price point. The boutique nature of this development—only 8 units—avoids the over-saturation that plagues larger complexes, potentially protecting both rental rates and capital value.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is this apartment suitable for permanent living?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. The 31m² studio works excellently for individuals or couples prioritising location over space. The city-centre location means you're never isolated—shops, restaurants, healthcare, and services are all within walking distance. Many residents choose studios specifically for this reason, valuing beach proximity and urban lifestyle over square metres. You'll find similar units occupied year-round by satisfied permanent residents."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are typical rental rates for centre-location studios in Torrevieja?",
      "answer": "Peak season (June-September) nightly rates typically range €60-90 for quality studio apartments in prime positions. Off-season (October-May) rates settle around €35-50 nightly. For annual lets to expats or local professionals, expect €400-550 monthly. Centre locations consistently outperform the tourist areas because of walkability and convenience, making this development particularly attractive for rental income."
    },
    {
      "question": "How established is Torrevieja for international buyers?",
      "answer": "Very well-established with deep roots. Torrevieja hosts approximately 30,000 UK residents and substantial Scandinavian, German, and Dutch communities. This isn't a speculative boom-town—it's a mature expat destination with established healthcare systems, international schools, English-language services, and genuine community. Property here attracts genuine owner-occupiers alongside investors, which historically stabilises values."
    },
    {
      "question": "What utilities and costs should I budget monthly?",
      "answer": "For a 31m² apartment: electricity (€40-70, summer higher with AC), water (€15-25), internet (€30-50), and community fees (typically €80-120 covering maintenance and common areas). These are approximate—actual costs depend on usage and seasonal variations. The small size keeps utility costs significantly lower than larger apartments, offsetting any premium for centre location."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is parking available nearby?",
      "answer": "This varies by specific unit location within the development. Some units include designated parking or communal parking options; others rely on nearby public street parking, which is available throughout Centro but can be congested during peak season. We recommend confirming the exact parking situation for your preferred unit before purchase. Many centre-location residents minimise car use given proximity to everything."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I furnish and rent this immediately after purchase?",
      "answer": "Yes. New-build properties can be furnished and listed immediately. Many investors furnish studios with quality basics (bed, sofa, kitchenware, bedding) for €2,000-4,000 and begin generating rental income within weeks. The growing number of platforms (Airbnb, Booking.com, Vrbo) make listing straightforward, and Torrevieja's established rental market means finding guests is typically not challenging for well-located centre properties."
