    },
    {
      "question": "Czy Costa Blanca to dobre miejsce na zakup nieruchomości?",
      "answer": "Yes, Costa Blanca ranks among Spain's most attractive property markets for international families. The region offers year-round Mediterranean climate (300+ days sunshine), established international communities with English widely spoken, excellent healthcare and education infrastructure, and consistent property appreciation (Costa Blanca saw +8% growth last year). The combination of affordability, lifestyle quality, and investment potential makes it ideal for families seeking permanent relocation or holiday investment homes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Czy obcokrajowcy mogą kupić nieruchomość w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners can purchase property in Spain with minimal restrictions. UK citizens, EU residents, and non-EU nationals all have equal rights to buy residential property. The process requires a Spanish tax identification number (NIE), which takes approximately one week to obtain. You'll need legal representation (gestoría) to handle documentation, which typically costs €800-1,500. Foreign ownership is straightforward and legally protected—thousands of British and international families own property without complications."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jakie są koszty zakupu nieruchomości w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "Beyond the property price, expect: transfer tax (6-10% depending on region—Alicante is 10%), legal fees (€800-1,500), property registry fee (€200-400), and survey costs (€300-500 optional). Total acquisition costs typically run 12-13% above the purchase price. Ongoing costs include municipal property tax (IBI—approximately €200-300 annually for this property), waste collection, and insurance (€30-50 monthly). Many families budget €5,000-7,000 for total acquisition costs on this price point."
    },
    {
      "question": "Czy potrzebuję wizy, żeby kupić nieruchomość w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically to purchase property in Spain. You can buy as a tourist or on a standard visitor permit. However, if you plan to reside in Spain (which most property buyers do), you'll need appropriate residency status. Post-Brexit UK citizens typically obtain residency through the Spanish authorities once purchasing property and demonstrating financial stability. EU citizens retain freedom of movement. The property purchase itself doesn't trigger visa requirements—residency and visa are separate administrative processes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Ile wynosi podatek od nieruchomości w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "Annual property tax (IBI) on this Los Montesinos villa runs approximately €200-300 annually, calculated as a percentage of the official property valuation. Transfer tax at purchase is 10% in Alicante (€36,900 on this property). Capital gains tax applies if you sell at profit, taxed at 19% on gains for non-residents, or included in income tax assessments for Spanish residents. Most families consider Spanish property taxes significantly lower than UK council tax and stamp duty combined, representing genuine savings over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Czy mogę uzyskać kredyt hipoteczny w Hiszpanii jako obcokrajowiec?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers can secure mortgages from Spanish banks, typically up to 70-80% of property value. Interest rates run 2.5-4% depending on your profile and loan-to-value ratio. Lenders require proof of income (employment contracts, tax returns), credit history, and NIE number. Many Spanish banks accept UK employment documentation and credit reports. However, some families find cash purchase simpler given competitive Spanish property prices—a €369,000 property is achievable for many households without financing. Mortgage advisory services specializing in expat lending can navigate the process efficiently."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jakie są koszty życia na Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca cost of living is typically 25-35% lower than UK equivalents. Groceries cost 15-20% less (Mercadona prices are substantially lower than Sainsbury's), dining out averages €8-15 for mains, and utilities run €80-120 monthly for a family home. School fees for private/international institutions range €3,000-7,000 annually (lower than UK independent schools). Healthcare through the Spanish public system costs nothing once resident (reciprocal NHS arrangement for UK citizens). Families typically live comfortably on €1,500-2,000 monthly beyond mortgage/rent."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jaka jest pogoda na Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually. Summers (June-September) average 28-32°C with minimal rainfall. Winters are mild (10-16°C), with occasional frost inland but rarely below freezing. Spring and autumn offer perfect 18-24°C temperatures for outdoor activities. The region receives roughly 280mm annual rainfall, mostly in autumn/winter, never creating the grey, damp conditions of UK winters. This climate enables year-round outdoor family activities—beach days in December are genuinely feasible, and children spend significantly more time in fresh air than UK peers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Los Montesinos good for families relocating from the UK?",
      "answer": "Los Montesinos is excellent for UK family relocation. The town has an established British and Northern European community, English is widely spoken, and schools teach British curriculum alongside Spanish education. Healthcare provides English-speaking doctors, shopping offers familiar brands, and the town balances authentic Spanish life with international accessibility. Proximity to beaches (20 minutes), golf courses, and international restaurants means family entertainment is abundant. The safe neighborhoods, school quality, and lower cost of living make Los Montesinos particularly attractive for families seeking quality-of-life improvement."
