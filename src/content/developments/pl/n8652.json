  "areaSection": "Pilar de La Horadada sits on the southern Costa Blanca, where Alicante province meets Murcia in a region celebrated for its authentic Spanish charm and unhurried pace. This pueblo, meaning 'village' in Spanish, maintains a genuine character despite modern amenities—narrow white-washed streets open onto plazas where locals gather for evening paseos, and the rhythm of life follows the Mediterranean calendar rather than tourist seasons.\n\nGeographically positioned just 10 kilometers from the border and close to major regional centers, Pilar de La Horadada enjoys a strategic location. The landscape features pine-covered hills meeting pristine coastline with multiple Blue Flag beaches within 20 minutes' drive. The climate is exceptional: 300+ days of annual sunshine, mild winters averaging 15°C, and dry summers cooled by sea breezes. This micro-climate has attracted retirees for decades precisely because it's gentle on bodies and spirits alike.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Life in Pilar de La Horadada centers on balance—vibrant enough for active engagement, quiet enough for genuine relaxation.

Local tapas bars serve €3-5 meals, weekly markets overflow with Mediterranean produce, and healthcare professionals understand expat healthcare expectations.\n\nWeekday mornings might involve a beach walk followed by coffee at a local café. Afternoons bring golf opportunities at championship courses, cultural visits to nearby towns, or simply reading by your bungalow in the sunshine. The pueblo maintains a proper community—restaurants, supermarkets, and services meet daily needs without the commercialization of larger resorts. Evenings feature sunset drinks, dinner with new friends from around Europe, and the simple pleasure of warm Mediterranean nights.
