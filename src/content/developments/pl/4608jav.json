Nestled between two dramatic headlands—the Cabo de la Nao peninsula—Javea benefits from a unique microclimate with over 300 days of sunshine annually. The town's geography creates natural protection from harsh winds while capturing Mediterranean warmth. Unlike the high-rise developments of nearby Benidorm, Javea has maintained its character with low-rise architecture and extensive green spaces. The landscape transitions from rugged rocky coastlines with hidden coves to pristine sandy beaches, creating stunning natural diversity. Sitting 110km south of Valencia, Javea occupies a sweet spot between accessibility and exclusivity.

The beaches are never overcrowded, even in summer, with options ranging from the popular Blue Flag Arenal to secluded coves accessible only by boat. Sunday mornings often mean browsing the local market, afternoons are spent on the water, and evenings unfold in family-run restaurants serving paella and fresh fish. Healthcare is exceptional, with English-speaking doctors throughout town and quality hospitals minutes away. The pace is unhurried yet never dull—there's always something to discover, from coastal walks to mountain hikes, water sports, or simply enjoying tapas with friends at a beachside café. Winter temperatures rarely drop below 15°C, making it genuinely livable year-round.",

      "question": "Can I rent this property as a holiday home?",

Annual rental income from similar properties averages €30,000-€45,000.

Your investment at €200,000 could generate compelling returns while serving as your personal holiday retreat."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the building potential for this land?",
      "answer": "Building potential depends on local planning codes and plot size, which should be verified with Javea's municipal planning office. Javea has deliberately limited building density to preserve the town's character—this protects your investment through supply scarcity while potentially limiting development size. Architects familiar with local regulations can design homes that honor Javea's aesthetic while maximizing functionality. Building costs in Spain average €1,200-€1,800 per square meter for quality construction. Many investors develop modest 2-3 bedroom holiday homes optimized for rental income rather than personal use."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this a good investment compared to other Costa Blanca areas?",
      "answer": "Javea represents excellent investment value. At €200,000, this land costs 30% less than Mallorca equivalents while offering superior lifestyle infrastructure and holiday rental demand. Unlike Benidorm (overdeveloped, mass tourism) or smaller towns (limited amenities), Javea balances exclusivity with convenience. The 6% annual appreciation trajectory exceeds most Spanish property markets. Holiday rental potential generates income that other Costa Blanca investments cannot match due to Javea's established international appeal. Smart investors recognize that Javea's deliberate growth restrictions naturally support long-term value appreciation through supply-demand dynamics."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the process to purchase this property as a non-Spanish resident?",
      "answer": "Non-EU citizens can purchase Spanish property straightforwardly through an established legal process. You'll need a Spanish NIE number (tax identification), open a Spanish bank account, and hire a gestoría (English-speaking legal firm) to handle documentation—essential for non-residents. Mortgages are available from Spanish banks offering 60-70% LTV financing at competitive rates to European buyers. Expect 6-8 weeks from offer to completion. Total purchase costs (taxes, legal, notary) are 7-10% of purchase price. We recommend consulting with our local legal partners who specialize in English-speaking buyer representation."
