  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is Los Balcones genuinely quieter than Torrevieja's beachfront areas?",
      "answer": "Yes. Los Balcones intentionally developed as a residential neighborhood rather than a tourist destination. You'll experience significantly fewer crowds, less nightlife activity, and genuinely peaceful evenings. Most residents are permanent or long-term visitors rather than tourists, creating authentic neighborhood dynamics. The trade-off is deliberate: proximity to beaches without the noise and congestion of seafront living."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the actual commute to Torrevieja town center and beaches?",
      "answer": "Torrevieja center is approximately 3km away, typically a 5-7 minute drive or 35-40 minute walk. Main beaches like Playa del Cura are roughly 4km distant, roughly 8-10 minutes by car. These distances are genuinely short enough for regular visits while far enough to avoid daily tourist traffic flows. The neighborhood maintains quiet character precisely because it's slightly removed from the main tourist corridor."
    },
    {
      "question": "What rental market exists for 3-bedroom properties in Los Balcones?",
      "answer": "Strong and consistent. Families and small groups specifically seek out Los Balcones for residential character and authentic neighborhood experience rather than typical resort facilities. Weekly rental rates for well-maintained 3-bedroom properties typically range from €600-900 depending on season and amenities. Many owners achieve 75-85% annual occupancy rates by marketing to quality long-term renters and small families rather than mass tourism market."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there genuine Spanish residents and local businesses in Los Balcones?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. This neighborhood was established as a Spanish residential area decades before tourist development. You'll find Spanish families, pensioners, and established local businesses alongside international residents. Spanish language remains genuinely useful for local interactions. This genuine multicultural character, rather than tourist-oriented English-speaking zones, makes it authentic and livable for long-term residence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are typical monthly costs beyond mortgage for property ownership?",
      "answer": "Council tax (IBI) typically runs €50-80 monthly. Community fees vary but average €30-60 monthly for maintained developments. Utilities for a 99m² property usually total €100-150 monthly. Insurance costs approximately €20-30 monthly. Total ongoing costs generally range €200-300 monthly depending on usage and specific property. These figures make ownership genuinely affordable compared to rental alternatives in equivalent locations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this a good property if I'm considering permanent relocation to Spain?",
      "answer": "Yes, particularly if you prioritize genuine community living over tourist amenities. Los Balcones offers established infrastructure, proven integration of international residents, accessible healthcare and services, and authentic Spanish neighborhood character. The quiet residential environment suits retirees and remote workers. You're close enough to beaches and town for weekend activities while maintaining peaceful daily living. Many property owners here are precisely permanent relocators who chose this neighborhood specifically for long-term livability rather than investment speculation."
