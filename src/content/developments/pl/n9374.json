Pinoso properties appreciate at approximately 8% year-on-year, outpacing many coastal areas while remaining affordable. At €2,967/m², this villa commands a premium to the €2,200/m² Pinoso average—justified by its superior plot size and specification—yet costs 40% less than equivalent properties on Mallorca or Ibiza.
