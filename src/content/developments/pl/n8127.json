Priced at €390,000 (€3,714/m²), this property sits 40% below comparable pricing in Spanish island markets while offering superior rental demand and capital appreciation potential.

  "areaSection": "Los Alcazares is a purpose-built resort community in Murcia, strategically positioned between Cartagena and the Mar Menor coastal zone. The area experiences over 300 days of sunshine annually with average temperatures of 18°C, creating year-round appeal for holiday rentals and retirement relocations. Developed around championship golf courses and modern infrastructure, Los Alcazares attracts international property investors specifically for its lower entry prices compared to Alicante provinces while maintaining strong tourist demand. The town sits 40 minutes from Alicante Airport and 50 minutes from Murcia Airport, making it accessible yet distinct from saturated coastal markets. Established in the 1990s as a planned community, Los Alcazares offers mature amenities, reliable services, and an established expat network that ensures both lifestyle comfort and reliable property management services for rental operators.",

The established international community ensures English speakers throughout local services—from healthcare to estate agents to restaurants. Weekday rhythms remain relaxed, with access to excellent supermarkets (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum), weekly markets, and local restaurants serving everything from traditional Spanish cuisine to international preferences. Healthcare is a significant strength: the regional hospital is 30 minutes away, private clinics dot the area, and English-speaking doctors are standard. Blue Flag beaches are 20 minutes by car, offering regular weekend options without crowded peak-season chaos. For families, international schools with British curriculum options provide stability. The golf-centric infrastructure means clubs, practice facilities, and competitive play are integrated into community life.

    },
    {
      "question": "Czy obcokrajowcy mogą kupić nieruchomość w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "Yes, completely. Non-EU and EU citizens have identical property acquisition rights in Spain. You do not require Spanish residency or visa to purchase property. Foreign ownership represents approximately 30% of Costa Blanca transactions.

For this €390,000 property, expect €31,200-39,000 in total costs. Mortgage arrangement (if applicable) adds 0.3-0.6% further.

Income tax applies only if the property generates rental income: non-resident rental operations are taxed at 19% on gross income (before expenses). Professional management services can optimize tax efficiency through Spanish VAT recapture."

Golf community attracts higher-spending demographics (typically €60K+ annual disposable income) supporting premium nightly rates and lower vacancy risk than mass-tourism coastal destinations. Lower development density creates quieter lifestyle while maintaining world-class amenities."
