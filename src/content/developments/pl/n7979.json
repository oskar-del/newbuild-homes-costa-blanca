  "areaSection": "Benijófar is a charming coastal town in southern Alicante, positioned between Torrevieja and Guardamar del Segura. Located just 10km from the Mediterranean coastline, the town offers the perfect balance between beach proximity and inland affordability. The area enjoys a Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of annual sunshine, mild winters, and warm summers moderated by sea breezes. This picturesque locality has evolved into a preferred destination for international property buyers seeking authentic Spanish coastal living without the inflated price tags of major resort towns. The town's strategic location provides easy access to regional amenities while maintaining a more relaxed, residential atmosphere. Benijófar's relatively recent development as an expat destination means infrastructure has been purpose-built for modern living standards.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why is this property cheaper than Spanish island properties?",
      "answer": "Benijófar benefits from later development and less intensive tourism marketing compared to established island resorts. This creates inefficiency where premium-specification new construction costs less than similar island properties. The trade-off is slightly less brand recognition rather than inferior quality—advantage to informed investors recognizing market mispricings."
