    {
      "question": "Ile kosztuje ta nieruchomość?",
      "answer": "€489,900. This 3-bedroom villa offers premium specifications at 40% cheaper rates than comparable Spanish island markets. Payment options include cash, mortgages through Spanish lenders (available to foreigners), and installment plans with developers. Contact us via WhatsApp for current payment terms and available financing options."
    },
    {
      "question": "Czy obcokrajowcy mogą kupić nieruchomość w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Foreigners have the same property purchase rights as Spanish citizens in Spain. UK nationals, EU citizens, and non-EU residents can all purchase residential property without restrictions. The process requires a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and involves a notary who ensures all legal requirements are met. We handle these formalities as part of our service, and the process typically completes within 4-8 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jakie są koszty zakupu nieruchomości w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "Beyond the property price, expect additional costs of approximately 8-10% for purchase expenses. These include notary fees (1%), registration (0.5-1%), tax (6-10% depending on if it's new or resale), and legal representation (0.5-1%). For a €489,900 property, budget roughly €40,000-50,000 total in additional costs. These are lower than UK stamp duty and fees, making Spanish property acquisition cost-effective."
    },
    {
      "question": "Czy Costa Blanca to dobre miejsce na zakup nieruchomości?",
      "answer": "Yes, Costa Blanca remains one of Europe's best property markets for families and investors. The region offers 300+ days of sunshine annually, excellent schools, affordable living, established infrastructure, and strong 8% annual property appreciation. Unlike saturated island markets, Costa Blanca provides balanced value with lower entry prices, lower living costs, and better rental yields—making it ideal for families balancing lifestyle with financial prudence."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jakie są koszty życia na Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Living costs in Rojales are 30-40% lower than the UK. Groceries, dining out, utilities, and services cost significantly less. A family of four typically spends €1,500-2,000 monthly for comfortable living (excluding mortgage). Healthcare, schooling, and entertainment are particularly affordable. The combination of low costs and high quality of life makes Costa Blanca exceptional value for expat families."
    },
    {
      "question": "Czy potrzebuję wizy, żeby kupić nieruchomość w Hiszpanii?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically for property purchase. UK nationals and most non-EU citizens can visit Spain visa-free for tourism. For residency (if you plan to live there permanently), you'll need to apply for a residence permit based on criteria like non-lucrative income, employment, or entrepreneurship. Property ownership itself doesn't require residency status—many families own here while living elsewhere, visiting seasonally."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can I earn renting this property?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca's established holiday rental market supports €800+ weekly income for quality 3-bedroom properties. Many owners generate €3,000-4,000 monthly during peak seasons (May-September) and €1,500-2,000 during shoulder seasons. Annual rental income of €30,000-35,000 is realistic for professional management. This helps offset mortgage costs and makes the property self-funding during school holidays when you might want to use it personally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is this villa cheaper than island properties?",
      "answer": "Rojales sits just inland from the coast rather than on beachfront, reducing land costs by 40-50% compared to island destinations. Yet it maintains all family amenities—beaches are only 15-20 minutes away. Additionally, Rojales' inland location means less international competition for properties, more balanced supply-demand, and lower speculation. You get premium specifications and quality living at a fraction of inflated coastal prices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this a good investment for families?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Beyond providing an exceptional family home, this property offers 8% annual appreciation, realistic rental income of €30,000-35,000 yearly, and lower costs than UK property ownership. Families can live here full-time, split their year between here and the UK, or use it as a holiday investment. The combination of lifestyle benefits, financial appreciation, and rental yields makes it increasingly rare at this price point."
    },
    {
      "question": "Jak daleko jest Costa Blanca od Polski?",
      "answer": "Alicante International Airport is 45 minutes away with regular direct flights to major UK airports (London, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow) taking approximately 2.5 hours. Budget flights operate daily, making weekend trips or frequent visits practical and affordable. Many families develop routines of spending school holidays here and returning to the UK during term time."
