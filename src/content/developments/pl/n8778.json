For property ownership and residency, you'll need a Spanish tax identification number (NIE), obtained through the Spanish embassy or locally once in Spain. If you plan to reside in Spain or spend significant time there, separate residency applications may apply—consult a specialist lawyer for your specific circumstances. Property ownership itself doesn't require residency, meaning non-resident owners commonly own Spanish properties for holidays or investment."
