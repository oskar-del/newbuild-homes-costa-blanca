  "metaTitle": "3-Bed Villa Los Urrutias €384,000 | Costa Blanca Family Home",
  "metaDescription": "Premium 3-bedroom villa in Los Urrutias, Murcia. €384,000. Perfect family home with space to grow, near schools & beaches. 40% less than island markets.",
  "heroIntro": "Welcome to your family's new chapter in Los Urrutias. This stunning 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom villa offers the space and lifestyle your growing family deserves, all at €384,000—representing exceptional value for a premium-specification home. Located in one of Costa Blanca's most family-friendly communities, this 120m² villa sits on a generous 195m² plot, providing the outdoor space children need to play and families need to thrive. What makes this property truly remarkable is the pricing: at €3,200 per square meter, you're paying 40% less than comparable properties in Spanish island markets, while enjoying the same Mediterranean climate, safety, and community infrastructure. With international schools in the region, excellent healthcare facilities, and established expat networks where English is widely spoken, Los Urrutias has become the go-to destination for British and European families seeking authentic Spanish living without compromising on modern amenities. This villa represents not just a home, but an investment in your family's quality of life, with rental potential of approximately €800 per week and a market trend showing consistent 8% year-on-year growth.",
  "areaSection": "Los Urrutias is a charming coastal municipality in the Region of Murcia, positioned perfectly between the vibrant cities of Cartagena and San Javier. Despite its proximity to major amenities, the town maintains a relaxed, authentic Spanish character that appeals to families seeking genuine community rather than tourist-driven development. The area benefits from a Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually, making outdoor living a genuine lifestyle rather than a seasonal luxury. Situated just 20 minutes from multiple Blue Flag beaches, Los Urrutias offers the perfect balance: a peaceful residential setting with immediate access to water sports, beach days, and coastal activities. The town has evolved significantly over the past decade, with modern infrastructure developments complementing traditional Spanish architecture. Local amenities have expanded dramatically, with supermarkets, restaurants, and services meeting international standards while maintaining local flavor. The area's elevation and coastal position provide natural cooling breezes, reducing reliance on air conditioning during summer months.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Los Urrutias revolves around family-friendly routines, community connections, and easy access to both relaxation and adventure. Your mornings might include coffee at a local café where English is spoken, your afternoons could feature beach time or visits to modern shopping centers like Mercadona and Lidl, and your evenings often involve dining at family-oriented restaurants with international cuisine options. The established expat community—primarily British, German, and Scandinavian—means your children will find peers and you'll discover ready-made social networks. Weekends offer flexibility: beach days at nearby Blue Flag beaches, golf outings at championship courses, or exploring the historic character of nearby Cartagena. Healthcare is accessible with English-speaking doctors and private clinics supplementing the regional hospital, giving families peace of mind. Public transport includes reliable bus connections, though most families find a car offers the flexibility modern family life requires. The pace is decidedly relaxed compared to UK coastal towns, yet amenities ensure nothing essential is far away. Your children will attend schools with British curriculum options if desired, while experiencing authentic Spanish culture through friendships and community events.",
  "investmentSection": "Beyond providing your family with an exceptional home, this villa offers solid investment fundamentals. Los Urrutias has experienced consistent 8% year-on-year property appreciation, outpacing broader Costa Blanca averages. At €3,200 per square meter, this property commands a premium within the local market (average €2,200/m²) due to superior specifications, yet remains 40% below island market pricing. The rental market validates the investment: comparable 3-bedroom properties command approximately €800 per week during peak season, translating to €41,600 annually if you choose to generate income. Many families offset mortgage costs through seasonal rental income while maintaining summer availability for their own use. The established expat community ensures consistent rental demand from relocating families. Should your circumstances change, the combination of strong capital appreciation and stable rental yields provides flexible exit strategies. Currency advantages further benefit British purchasers, with euro stability making long-term financial planning straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This villa represents more than property acquisition—it's investment in your family's lifestyle transformation. At €384,000, you're acquiring a premium-specification home in an established, family-friendly community where your children will thrive, your healthcare needs are met by English-speaking professionals, and your daily life balances Mediterranean relaxation with modern convenience. The investment fundamentals are equally compelling: 8% year-on-year appreciation, €800 weekly rental potential, and 40% valuation advantage versus island markets. Whether you're seeking permanent relocation, a second home base in Europe, or a strategic property investment generating genuine returns, Los Urrutias offers clarity and confidence impossible in many property markets. The established expat community eliminates isolation concerns while authentic Spanish character ensures genuine cultural immersion if desired.
