  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why is a central location better than a beachfront property in Torrevieja?",
      "answer": "Central properties offer superior rental yields because they appeal to year-round renters and diverse visitor types, not just beach-focused tourists. Beachfront premiums inflate purchase prices without proportional income returns. This location provides beach access (600m) while capturing vibrant urban demand. You also avoid beachfront maintenance issues and benefit from Torrevieja's thriving restaurant and cultural scene."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes this penthouse suitable for short-term rentals?",
      "answer": "The 1-bed, 2-bath configuration appeals to couples, business travelers, and small families—high-value rental demographics. Modern finishes and contemporary design command premium rates. Central location means guests enjoy walking access to dining and entertainment, increasing satisfaction and reviews. Torrevieja's 2+ million annual visitors provide consistent demand across all seasons."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Torrevieja a safe place to invest right now?",
      "answer": "Torrevieja represents one of Spain's most established international property markets with over 30 years of foreign investment history. The centro district specifically has benefited from municipal regeneration projects. Property values show resilience, and the international resident community (Germans, British, Scandinavians) provides demographic stability. New build construction meets modern Spanish building standards and regulations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are typical running costs for this penthouse?",
      "answer": "Modern new build apartments have minimal maintenance needs. Annual costs typically include community fees (shared building services), property taxes, and utilities. The absence of a pool or large common areas keeps community fees reasonable compared to resort-style developments. Exact figures depend on final community regulations, but expect moderate, predictable costs typical of Spanish residential apartments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could I live here full-time or should I invest as a rental property?",
      "answer": "This penthouse works excellently for both strategies. The centro location suits permanent residents seeking urban Mediterranean living with beach proximity. Alternatively, it's a strong rental investment with dual revenue potential—holiday rentals for tourists plus long-term rental demand from international professionals moving to Costa Blanca. Many owners enjoy hybrid approaches, using the property seasonally while renting during peak periods."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the rental market like in Torrevieja's centro?",
      "answer": "Torrevieja's centro is experiencing strong rental growth driven by tourism (2+ million annual visitors), international relocation, and seasonal visitor demand. Holiday rentals typically achieve 60-70% annual occupancy rates or higher. Long-term rental demand remains solid from expats and temporary workers. Modern, centrally-located apartments command premium rates, and competition from outdated properties means quality new builds maintain pricing power."
