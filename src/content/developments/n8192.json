  "investmentSection": "This property represents compelling investment fundamentals for European buyers seeking Mediterranean real estate exposure. Algorfa's market has appreciated 12% year-on-year, significantly outpacing broader Spanish property averages, driven by limited new development and consistent international demand. The villa's strategic pricing—€4,084/m² compared to €2,000-€3,000/m² in less prestigious inland locations, and 50% below comparable coastal developments—provides immediate value positioning. Rental performance supports returns: seasonal lettings command approximately €900 per week (€3,600 monthly during peak season), generating 8-12% annual yields for absentee investors. The established La Finca Golf community attracts affluent golf enthusiasts and lifestyle-focused retirees seeking long-term residency, ensuring stable tenant quality and occupancy rates. Long-term capital appreciation prospects remain favorable given scarcity of premium villa stock in established communities, international demand sustainability, and the property's position within a prestigious gated development.",
