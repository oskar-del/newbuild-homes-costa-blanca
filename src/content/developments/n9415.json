  "metaDescription": "3-bedroom apartment in Benijofar, Alicante. €350,000. Premium specification, 40% below island prices. Strong rental income potential. 115m² built.",
  "heroIntro": "This 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Benijofar represents a compelling investment opportunity in one of Costa Blanca's most sought-after locations. Priced at €350,000 (€3,043/m²), this property offers premium specification at 40% below comparable Spanish island markets, making it an attractive entry point for investors seeking capital appreciation and rental income. The Benijofar market has demonstrated consistent growth of 8% year-on-year, with typical holiday let yields of €800 per week driving strong investor demand. At 115m² of well-designed living space, this apartment balances the demand for spacious accommodation with the low-maintenance appeal that rental operators prioritize. Located in an established community with robust infrastructure and excellent expat networks, this property sits at the intersection of personal appeal and commercial viability. The price premium of 38% above the local €2,200/m² average reflects the property's superior specification and proven rental demand, positioning it as a smart capital deployment for income-focused investors.",
  "areaSection": "Benijofar is a charming pueblo on the Costa Blanca, strategically positioned between the larger tourist centers of Torrevieja and Orihuela. The town combines authentic Spanish character with modern infrastructure, making it increasingly attractive to discerning buyers. Located in the Vega Baja region, Benijofar enjoys a Mediterranean climate with 300+ days of sunshine annually, offering reliably pleasant weather year-round. The town has experienced measured growth without losing its residential identity, unlike overdeveloped coastal areas. Elevation provides natural cooling and cleaner air, a significant advantage over lower-lying developments. The established community infrastructure—hospitals, schools, shopping—means the town functions as a genuine residential hub rather than a seasonal resort. This positioning has attracted a diverse demographic, from young families to retirees, creating diverse rental demand patterns that support strong occupancy rates throughout the year.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Benijofar combines Mediterranean authenticity with cosmopolitan convenience. The expat community is well-established and English-speaking, reducing the friction of relocation. You'll find excellent restaurants ranging from traditional Spanish tapas bars to international cuisine, fresh produce at weekly markets, and major supermarket chains within walking distance. The beaches—multiple Blue Flag awarded—are a 20-minute drive, perfect for weekend visits without the daily tourist congestion of resort towns. Golf enthusiasts can access several championship courses nearby, and healthcare quality is exceptional with English-speaking doctors at regional hospitals and private clinics. The social calendar includes community events, sports clubs, and networking opportunities. Transport connections via bus are reliable for those preferring public transit, though a car provides flexibility for exploring the broader Costa Blanca region. This blend of practical amenities and lifestyle variety creates the foundation for sustainable long-term rental demand.",

  "investmentSection": "The Benijofar market demonstrates robust fundamentals for investor returns. Market appreciation of 8% year-on-year outpaces inflation and treasury returns, while the €3,043/m² pricing positions this property at a 38% premium to the €2,200/m² area average—reflecting superior specification and rental appeal rather than speculative markup. Holiday let rental data shows consistent €800/week (approximately €4,200/month during peak seasons, €2,500/month shoulder, €1,800/month off-season), supporting annual gross rental income of €42,000-€52,000 depending on management intensity. Net yields after maintenance, management fees (typically 20-25%), and vacancy (estimated 15-20%) suggest 5-7% annual returns, with capital appreciation potentially doubling total returns. The three-bedroom configuration aligns with peak demand (families vacationing together) and long-term rental demand (employer-sponsored housing). This dual-market positioning reduces vacancy risk compared to smaller units dependent primarily on couples and singles. The 40% discount to island market pricing (Balearics, Canaries) provides significant capital appreciation upside as Costa Blanca gains investor attention.",
