    },
    {
      "question": "Can foreigners buy property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Foreign nationals can purchase Spanish property without restrictions or special permits.

    },
    {
      "question": "Is Costa Blanca a good place to buy property?",
      "answer": "Absolutely, particularly for holiday home buyers and retirees. Costa Blanca offers year-round sunshine (320+ days annually), established expat communities, excellent healthcare, and proven property appreciation.

    },
    {
      "question": "What are the costs of buying property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect approximately 8-10% in additional costs: 6% property transfer tax, legal fees (€1,500-€3,000), notary fees (€400-€800), and registration costs.

      "answer": "Yes. Spanish banks routinely offer mortgages to foreign property buyers, typically at 70-80% LTV (loan-to-value).

Some British expats arrange UK mortgages instead, which remains possible for primary residences."

      "answer": "Approximately 1,200 miles. Almería Airport (55 minutes from Vera) offers daily direct flights to London and other UK airports—typically 3.5-4 hours flight time. Ryanair, easyJet, and Iberia operate regular routes. This proximity makes weekend UK visits practical while maintaining Spanish residency."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the weather like on Costa Blanca?",

This climate is ideal for year-round outdoor living—beach swimming, golf, and outdoor dining remain feasible even in winter months."
    },
    {
      "question": "What rental income can I expect from this property?",
      "answer": "Conservative estimates suggest €800 per week (€3,200 monthly) during peak season with 60-70% annual occupancy. This translates to approximately €35,000-€40,000 annually after accounting for seasonal variation. Off-season rentals (€500-€600 weekly) and special event periods boost overall returns. Professional property management companies in Vera handle bookings, cleaning, and guest services for 30-35% commission."
