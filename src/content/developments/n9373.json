Typical mortgages offer 70-80% of property value at competitive rates (currently 3-4%). You'll need proof of income, employment contracts, and financial documentation. Non-EU buyers may find slightly stricter requirements. Many international buyers work with mortgage brokers specializing in foreign clients to streamline the process."
