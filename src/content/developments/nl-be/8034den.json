  "metaDescription": "Exclusief 6-bedroom villa in prestigious La Pedrera, Denia. Sea views, sophisticated design. €790,000 - competitively priced Costa Blanca property.",
  "heroIntro": "This exceptional 6-bedroom villa in La Pedrera represents a rare opportunity to acquire a premium property in one of Costa Blanca's most discerning locations. Positioned at €790,000, this residence offers remarkable value—priced at the Denia area average while delivering the sophisticated design and exclusive positioning that sophisticated buyers demand. The property commands enviable sea views, providing the coastal lifestyle that defines Mediterranean luxury living. With 41 professional images documenting every detail, this villa exemplifies the quality and attention to detail expected in the premium segment. For international buyers seeking a prestigious base on the Costa Blanca, this property combines strategic pricing with the intangible appeal of La Pedrera's established community of discerning residents. The current market shows robust fundamentals, with Costa Blanca properties appreciating at 7% year-on-year—a compelling investment backdrop for buyers seeking both lifestyle and financial prudence.",
  "areaSection": "Denia, positioned at the northern gateway of the Costa Blanca, occupies a unique geographic position where the Mediterranean meets the Sierra de Bernia foothills. This coastal municipality of approximately 42,000 residents benefits from a privileged microclimate—warmer winters and refreshing sea breezes moderate the summer heat. The town's strategic location places it just 100km from Valencia, 120km from Alicante, and within ferry range of Ibiza and Mallorca. La Pedrera, the neighborhood encompassing this property, represents one of Denia's most established and prestigious residential zones, historically favored by international families seeking permanence rather than transient holiday lets. The area combines genuine community infrastructure with maintained standards that appeal to quality-conscious buyers.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Denia offers a sophisticated Mediterranean rhythm without the intensity of larger coastal developments. The expat community—predominantly British, German, Dutch, and French—has established genuine social infrastructure: respected international schools, English-speaking medical practitioners, and cosmopolitan dining. Daily life centers around the remarkable Thursday and Friday street markets offering fresh Mediterranean produce, alongside modern supermarkets (Mercadona, Carrefour, Consum) for international staples. The beaches vary distinctly: Las Marinas provides extensive sandy shores popular with families, while Les Rotes offers dramatic rocky coves favored by those seeking seclusion. Golf enthusiasts enjoy three championship courses within 20 minutes. Healthcare access is comprehensive, with Hospital de Dénia (Marina Salud) providing modern facilities with English-speaking staff. The town maintains the essential infrastructure of a genuine community—not merely a resort—making it exceptionally appealing for those prioritizing long-term residency and authentic integration.",
  "investmentSection": "Costa Blanca properties demonstrate compelling fundamentals: year-on-year appreciation of 7% reflects sustained demand from international buyers and limited new supply in premium segments. This property, priced at €790,000 in a market averaging €2,500/m², positions favorably against comparable Costa Brava properties that command 35% premium pricing for equivalent specifications. Rental income potential substantiates investment appeal—similar properties generate €900+ weekly during peak season, providing 20-25% annual returns for those pursuing income-generating strategies. The comprehensive English-speaking infrastructure, established international community, and proximity to Ibiza create distinctive rental demand dynamics. Denia's transformation from traditional fishing village to sophisticated residential hub has created genuine scarcity in premium segments, supporting medium-term appreciation expectations.",
  "conclusion": "This villa in La Pedrera represents the convergence of value, positioning, and lifestyle that defines sophisticated property acquisition. At €790,000, it offers pricing alignment with the area average while commanding sea views, established positioning, and the infrastructure supporting long-term residency. The combination of appreciation fundamentals, rental income potential, and Mediterranean lifestyle appeal creates a compelling proposition for discerning international buyers.

    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders eigendom kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes. Non-EU citizens and EU nationals have identical property purchase rights in Spain. The process requires obtaining a Spanish tax identification number (NIF), engaging qualified legal representation, and completing standard conveyancing procedures. Most international buyers work with English-speaking lawyers specializing in property transactions to streamline the process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten om eigendom te kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Purchase costs typically total 8-12% beyond the property price: transfer tax (7-11% depending on region), notary fees (€500-1,500), legal representation (€1,500-3,000), and registration costs (€300-600). For a €790,000 property, expect approximately €63,200-94,800 in additional costs. These figures are standard across Spain and predictable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan ik als buitenlander een hypotheek krijgen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes. Most Spanish banks and international lenders offer mortgages to non-residents and EU citizens. Loan-to-value ratios typically reach 70-80% for owner-occupied properties, with competitive interest rates comparable to northern Europe. British banks including Santander, HSBC, and specialist lenders facilitate cross-border financing arrangements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van levensonderhoud aan de Costa Blanca?",

Housing costs are the primary expense variable, with significant variation by location and property type."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca geschikt voor gepensioneerden?",
      "answer": "Yes. Costa Blanca is exceptionally popular with retirees—particularly British and northern European pensioners—due to year-round climate, affordable cost of living, modern healthcare with English-speaking practitioners, and established retirement communities. The non-habitual resident (NHR) tax status provides favorable taxation for qualifying pensioners. Communities like Denia integrate retirees into genuine social structures rather than age-segregated communities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe is het weer aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Mediterranean climate provides 320+ sunshine days annually. Summer temperatures peak at 28-32°C (June-September) with refreshing sea breezes. Winters remain mild: December-February average 10-15°C with minimal rainfall. Spring and autumn deliver perfect conditions: 18-24°C with low humidity. The coastal position at La Pedrera modulates temperature extremes compared to inland areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe ver is de Costa Blanca van België?",
      "answer": "Alicante Airport (110km from Denia) provides direct flights to UK destinations in approximately 2-2.5 hours. Regular scheduled services operate from London (Gatwick, Stansted, Luton), Manchester, Birmingham, and other major UK airports. Budget carriers (Ryanair, easyJet) offer frequent service at competitive pricing, making regular UK visits practical for property owners."
    },
    {
      "question": "Heb ik een visum nodig om eigendom te kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically for property purchase. EU citizens enjoy unrestricted residency rights. Non-EU citizens can purchase property through standard commercial procedures without visa complications, though residency visas (golden visa, investor visa, or residency permits) become relevant if planning extended stays beyond tourist allowances."
