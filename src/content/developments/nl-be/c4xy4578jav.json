Priced at €795,000, this property represents a sophisticated opportunity for discerning buyers seeking the finest Mediterranean lifestyle. Javea has established itself as a premier destination for high-net-worth individuals and established families, offering a compelling alternative to more crowded Costa Blanca developments. This villa embodies the premium positioning that defines Costa Nova—a neighbourhood celebrated for its refined character and enviable location. At €0 per square metre, this property is competitively priced against the Javea market average of €3,200/m², offering exceptional value for those seeking quality over quantity. The combination of prestigious location, thoughtful design, and strategic pricing makes this an opportunity worthy of serious consideration from buyers who understand the nuances of Mediterranean property investment.",
  "areaSection": "Javea, situated at the northeastern tip of the Costa Blanca, occupies a unique geographical position between the rugged Montgó mountain and the sparkling Mediterranean. This positioning creates a distinctive microclimate, with reliably mild winters and sun-drenched summers moderated by sea breezes. The town's elevated reputation stems from its careful preservation of character—unlike neighbouring developments, Javea maintains strict building regulations that protect its architectural integrity. The area has become synonymous with quality of life, attracting an international community of professionals, entrepreneurs, and retirees who prioritise substance over superficiality. Costa Nova specifically represents the pinnacle of Javea's residential offerings, with properties commanding premium positioning due to proximity to beaches, reduced noise pollution, and enhanced privacy. The surrounding landscape combines dramatic coastal cliffs, hidden coves, and golden beaches, creating an environment where natural beauty remains paramount.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Javea means embracing a sophisticated European lifestyle where international standards meet Mediterranean authenticity. The town supports an established community of British, German, and Dutch residents—sufficiently large to provide familiar networks and English-speaking services, yet small enough to maintain genuine Spanish character. Daily life revolves around quality rather than novelty: morning café culture, leisurely beach days at award-winning beaches like Arenal (Blue Flag designation), and evening dining at acclaimed local restaurants. Healthcare is comprehensively managed through English-speaking doctors and modern facilities including Hospital de Dénia just 15 minutes away. International schools including Xàbia International College (British curriculum) serve families, while the growing expat infrastructure means professional services—legal, financial, medical—operate fluently in English. The weekly markets deliver fresh produce from local farmers, while supermarkets like Mercadona and the British Corner Shop satisfy international preferences. This balance—cosmopolitan amenities within an authentically Spanish setting—defines the Javea experience.",
  "investmentSection": "The Costa Blanca property market has demonstrated consistent appreciation, with the broader region experiencing 6% year-on-year growth over recent cycles. Javea specifically outperforms this trend, attributed to its status-consciousness and limited new development due to strict planning regulations. This villa presents rental potential estimated at €1,400 per week during peak summer season—approximately €72,800 annually for 8-week bookings—making it viable as both primary residence and income-generating asset. Javea properties command rental premiums versus comparable Benidorm properties due to perceived quality positioning and appeal to discerning travellers. The property sits 30% below Mallorca equivalent pricing while offering superior Mediterranean authenticity. Long-term appreciation potential remains strong due to geographical constraints limiting supply and consistent demand from affluent international buyers seeking established, refined neighbourhoods.",
  "conclusion": "This 3-bedroom villa in Costa Nova, Javea represents a genuine opportunity for discerning international buyers seeking sophisticated Mediterranean living without compromise. The combination of exclusive location, competitive pricing at Javea market rates, strong investment fundamentals, and comprehensive expatriate infrastructure creates compelling positioning for families, professionals, and retirees alike.
