    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders eigendom kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, non-resident foreigners have equal property purchasing rights as Spanish citizens. No special permits or licenses are required—the process involves obtaining a Spanish tax identification number (NIE), signing the purchase agreement, and registering with the Land Registry. Most UK families complete purchases within 8-12 weeks with professional legal guidance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten om eigendom te kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price (€383,500 in this case), expect: transfer tax (6-10% depending on region), legal fees (€1,500-2,500), notary fees (€800-1,200), and registry costs (€300-500).

    },
    {
      "question": "Heb ik een visum nodig om eigendom te kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically for purchasing property in Spain. However, if you plan to reside in the property for more than 90 days annually, you'll need residency documentation (Non-Lucrative Visa, Golden Visa, or EU residency). Many UK families obtain residency status separately from property purchase for clarity and healthcare access."
    },

      "answer": "De jaarlijkse onroerende voorheffing (Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles) typically range from 0.4% to 1.1% of the property's assessed cadastral value—roughly €400-1,100 annually for properties in this price range. Additionally, local council tax (approximately €200-300 yearly) supports municipal services. These are significantly lower than UK council tax equivalents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan ik als buitenlander een hypotheek krijgen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, many Spanish banks offer mortgages to foreign buyers, typically up to 70-80% of property value with competitive interest rates (currently 3-4%). Requirements include NIE tax identification, proof of income, and employment verification. Many UK families successfully obtain mortgages, though Spanish banks may require higher deposits than UK lenders."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van levensonderhoud aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca cost of living is substantially lower than the UK. Family groceries average €300-400 monthly (vs. €500-600 in UK), meals at local restaurants cost €8-12, and utilities approximately €80-120 monthly. Overall, families report living costs 30-40% lower than equivalent UK standards, making €1,500-2,000 monthly budgets comfortable for families."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca geschikt voor gepensioneerden?",

      "answer": "International School of Almería (20 km) offers British curriculum education, while local Spanish primary schools provide language immersion within walking distance. Multiple private international options exist within 30 minutes. Many families choose Spanish schools for genuine cultural integration while maintaining English language skills at home."
