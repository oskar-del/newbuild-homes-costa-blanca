With typical holiday lettings generating €800 per week, investors can expect solid annual returns through the robust tourism market. The Costa Blanca region has demonstrated consistent +8% year-on-year property appreciation, positioning this Pilar de La Horadada apartment as both a cash-generating asset and a sound capital appreciation play. The 81m² built area maximizes efficiency, appealing to both short-term holiday renters seeking modern comfort and long-term tenants seeking beachside living. For investment-focused buyers, this property offers multiple revenue streams: holiday let bookings during peak seasons, long-term rental contracts, and organic appreciation as regional demand continues to outpace supply.",
  "areaSection": "Pilar de La Horadada is a distinctive coastal municipality in southern Alicante, positioned between the more developed Orihuela and Torrevieja. This strategic location offers the best of both worlds: direct beachfront access via Playa de las Higuericas with its unspoiled Blue Flag designation, yet close enough to major amenities and infrastructure. The Mediterranean climate delivers 320+ sunny days annually, with mild winters and warm summers ideal for year-round tourism. Geographically, the town sits on the Vega Baja del Segura coast, characterized by pristine sandy beaches, dramatic rocky outcrops, and protected natural areas. The relatively untouched nature of Pilar de La Horadada, compared to neighboring tourist hotspots, creates authentic appeal for discerning travelers and residents seeking genuine coastal character without over-development.",

  "investmentSection": "This property exemplifies disciplined real estate investment strategy. At €4,925/m², it commands a significant premium over Pilar de La Horadada's €2,200/m² average—justified by beachfront positioning, modern specification, and proven rental demand.
