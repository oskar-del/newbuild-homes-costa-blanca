      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca een goede plek om eigendom te kopen?",
      "answer": "Yes, Costa Blanca remains one of Spain's most attractive property markets, particularly for families and retirees. The region combines Mediterranean beaches, excellent climate (320+ days sunshine annually), growing international communities, and affordable living costs compared to northern Europe.

However, different areas offer different value propositions—Torre Pacheco specifically offers better value than saturated coastal towns while maintaining beach proximity and excellent amenities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders eigendom kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, non-EU and EU citizens can purchase property in Spain without restrictions. As a foreigner, you'll need to obtain a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and follow standard conveyancing procedures, typically handled by Spanish solicitors (abogados) and notaries. Most property transactions involving foreigners proceed smoothly, particularly in established international communities like Torre Pacheco where professionals regularly assist international buyers. Legal and conveyancing costs typically amount to 6-10% of the purchase price."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten om eigendom te kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect additional costs including: transfer tax (6-8% depending on region), notary and registry fees (1-1.5%), legal fees (1-2%), and property valuation (0.3-0.5%). These total approximately 10-12% of the purchase price. For this €259,900 property, total acquisition costs would be approximately €26,000-31,000. After purchase, annual costs include property tax (IBI, typically 0.4-0.6% of cadastral value), community fees if applicable, and utility costs (significantly lower than UK equivalents)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoeveel bedraagt de onroerende voorheffing in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Spain's property tax (Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles, or IBI) typically ranges from 0.4-0.6% of the property's cadastral value annually. For a property valued at €259,900, annual IBI tax would be approximately €1,000-1,500, depending on local rates in Torre Pacheco. Additionally, property owners pay capital gains tax if selling at a profit (21% for residents, 19% for non-residents). Rental income from property is taxed as ordinary income. Spanish property taxation is generally considered reasonable by European standards."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan ik als buitenlander een hypotheek krijgen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, several Spanish banks offer mortgages to non-EU and EU citizens, though terms may be stricter than for Spanish residents. Typical mortgage arrangements are 75-80% of property value with 20-25 year terms. Interest rates are currently competitive at approximately 3.5-4.5% depending on your deposit and credit profile. You'll need to provide proof of income, identity documents, and typically require a Spanish tax number (NIE). Many international buyers find Spanish mortgages attractive compared to refinancing in their home countries. Specialist mortgage brokers can navigate the application process for foreign buyers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van levensonderhoud aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Cost of living in Costa Blanca is 30-40% lower than comparable UK expenses, particularly for groceries, dining, and utility costs. Supermarket shopping is significantly cheaper due to Spain's competitive retail market, and local markets offer exceptional value for fresh produce. Dining out, including quality restaurants, costs considerably less than UK equivalents. Utilities (electricity, water, gas) run approximately 40% cheaper than UK rates, especially given year-round sunshine reduces heating needs. Healthcare costs are minimal with public system access, and private services are affordable. This affordability makes Torre Pacheco particularly attractive for families and retirees."

Summers are hot and dry (June-September), while winters are mild with occasional rain (December-February). The region experiences very little snow, and the microclimate around Torre Pacheco is particularly pleasant due to proximity to sea breezes and inland terrain. This exceptional climate enables year-round outdoor activities, beach visits, and garden enjoyment. Many families and retirees specifically relocate to Costa Blanca for the reliable, healthy climate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe ver is de Costa Blanca van België?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is approximately 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from the UK.
