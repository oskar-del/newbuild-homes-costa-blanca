  "metaDescription": "Peaceful 2-bedroom town house in Orihuela Costa for €280,000. Premium build, expat community, near golf & beaches. Ideal retirement home.",
  "heroIntro": "Welcome to a peaceful retirement sanctuary in Orihuela Costa, where year-round Spanish sunshine meets a thriving international expat community. This charming 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom town house offers the relaxed lifestyle you've earned, priced at just €280,000 with premium specification—remarkably 35% less expensive than comparable properties on Costa Blanca North. Located in the well-established PAU 26 residential area, you'll discover a welcoming neighbourhood where English is widely spoken, healthcare is readily accessible, and the pace of life encourages genuine relaxation. Whether you're seeking a permanent retirement home or a vacation retreat in the Spanish sun, this property delivers exceptional value without compromising on quality. With 93m² of thoughtfully designed living space, modern amenities, and easy access to golden beaches, championship golf courses, and quality medical facilities, this is more than just a property—it's your ticket to the Mediterranean lifestyle you've always imagined. The strong British, Scandinavian, and Dutch communities here ensure you'll never feel isolated, while maintaining the authentic Spanish charm that makes retirement on the Costa Blanca so special.",
  "areaSection": "Orihuela Costa stretches along the southern Costa Blanca, a mature and established destination that has evolved far beyond typical beach resort stereotypes. This area benefits from a south-facing coastline that guarantees exceptional sunshine—over 300 days annually—while being sheltered from northern weather patterns. The landscape here blends urban conveniences with genuine Mediterranean character: tree-lined streets, well-maintained residential areas, and direct access to some of Spain's finest beaches. Located approximately 50km south of Alicante airport and just 15km north of Murcia airport, Orihuela Costa occupies a sweet spot geographically, offering excellent connectivity without the chaos of larger cities. The town has genuinely mixed Spanish and international populations, creating a balanced, cosmopolitan atmosphere where local traditions coexist comfortably with international services and English-speaking professionals.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Life in Orihuela Costa revolves around a refreshingly unhurried rhythm that attracts retirees seeking authentic relaxation without isolation. Your days might begin with coffee at a local café where neighbours from six different countries exchange recommendations in fluent English. Mid-morning could involve a round of golf at nearby Villamartín championship course, followed by fresh fish lunch at one of numerous beach-front restaurants. The weekly markets burst with Mediterranean produce, while supermarkets like Mercadona and Consum stock everything from British tea to Spanish specialities. Healthcare here is notably reassuring—English-speaking doctors are standard, hospitals are modern and well-equipped, and preventative care is taken seriously. Social opportunities abound: walking clubs, painting groups, bridge tournaments, and countless expat organisations ensure genuine community connection. Beaches are genuinely accessible—La Zenia's Blue Flag award and Campoamor's golden sands are 10-15 minutes away—yet you're far enough inland to avoid tourist season chaos.",
  "investmentSection": "From a financial perspective, this property represents intelligent value in a market experiencing sustained growth. Orihuela Costa has appreciated approximately 10% year-on-year, reflecting genuine demand from both European retirees and international investors. At €3,011/m², you're paying a premium for quality specification—yet crucially, this remains 35% below comparable properties on Costa Blanca North, where similar town houses command €4,600+/m². The rental market here proves equally attractive: identical properties generate consistent €800/week revenue during peak season, suggesting potential annual rental income of €20,000-€25,000 if you choose the holiday letting route. Many purchasers adopt a hybrid approach—enjoying the property personally while letting it generate income during their absence. Established infrastructure, stable expat communities, and improving transport links suggest Orihuela Costa will continue attracting international buyers, supporting long-term value retention and appreciation.",
  "conclusion": "This 2-bedroom town house represents precisely what discerning retirees seek: genuine Mediterranean lifestyle at exceptional value. Priced at €280,000 with premium specification, set in an established community where English is widely spoken, healthcare is accessible, and year-round sunshine supports the relaxed retirement you've earned—this is your genuine opportunity to transition from holiday visitor to contented resident. The strong expat community ensures you're never isolated, while authentic Spanish character prevents the bubble of purely expat enclaves. Whether you view this purely as a retirement home, a regular holiday base, or an investment generating €20,000+ annual rental income, the fundamentals support confidence. Orihuela Costa's position between authentic Spanish lifestyle and established international community, combined with championship golf, golden beaches, and modern healthcare, creates a genuinely compelling proposition.

    {
      "question": "Is Orihuela Costa a good place to live?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely—particularly for retirees prioritising peaceful lifestyle, affordable living costs, excellent healthcare, and established expat communities. Orihuela Costa has matured into a genuinely balanced town where English is widely spoken, Spanish character remains authentic, and infrastructure supports comfortable independence. Over 300 days annual sunshine, proximity to beaches and golf, and cost of living 30-40% below northern Europe make it exceptionally popular with British, Scandinavian, and Dutch retirees."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Orihuela Costa known for?",
      "answer": "Orihuela Costa is renowned for world-class championship golf courses (Villamartín, Las Ramblas, Campoamor), pristine Blue Flag beaches, exceptional year-round climate, and a thriving international expat community. It's equally known for offering authentic Spanish lifestyle without the tourist chaos of more famous Costa Blanca areas, making it particularly attractive to permanent residents and retirees seeking genuine integration rather than isolated enclaves."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Orihuela Costa safe?",
      "answer": "Yes, Orihuela Costa is genuinely safe—consistently ranking well for security and community policing. Established residential areas like PAU 26 feature gated communities with controlled access, while the substantial international population means police and local authorities actively maintain standards. Property crime rates are low, violent crime is rare, and residents report feeling secure walking at reasonable hours—comparable to or better than most European retirement destinations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far is Orihuela Costa from Alicante?",
      "answer": "Orihuela Costa lies approximately 50km south of Alicante-Elche Airport—roughly 50 minutes drive via the A-7 motorway. However, Murcia Airport is only 15 minutes away and increasingly offers direct European flights, making it often more convenient. The trade-off is clear: southern location provides authentic Spanish character and lower costs, while remaining within reasonable distance of major transport hubs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you rent out this property for holiday lets?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Identical properties in PAU 26 consistently generate €800/week rental income during peak season, suggesting potential annual yields of €20,000-€25,000 if you choose holiday letting. Many owners adopt a hybrid approach—using the property personally while letting it generate income during absence. Rental management companies are well-established here and handle bookings, cleaning, and guest communication professionally."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the healthcare access like in Orihuela Costa?",
      "answer": "Healthcare is exceptional—Hospital de Torrevieja (15 minutes) offers comprehensive modern facilities with English-speaking doctors, while Quirónsalud private hospital (20 minutes) provides premium options. Local medical centres employ multilingual staff, Spanish prescriptions are remarkably affordable, and the overall healthcare system is consistently rated among Europe's finest. For retirees, this represents genuine peace of mind regarding medical care access and quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to speak Spanish to live in Orihuela Costa?",
      "answer": "No—English is genuinely widely spoken throughout residential and commercial areas, reflecting substantial British, Scandinavian, and Dutch populations. Most essential services (healthcare, administration, shopping) have English-speaking staff. That said, learning basic Spanish significantly enriches your experience, enables deeper community integration, and proves invaluable for appointments and administration. Many retirees find language learning an enjoyable retirement activity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the cost of living compared to the UK?",
      "answer": "Cost of living is remarkably lower—typically 30-40% below equivalent UK expenditure. Groceries, dining, utilities, healthcare, and entertainment all cost substantially less. A comfortable retirement lifestyle costs significantly fewer euros annually than pounds spent in Britain, making this genuinely attractive financially. However, property prices have increased in recent years; this town house at €280,000 represents good value relative to quality specification."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this a good investment property?",
      "answer": "Yes, the fundamentals are strong. Orihuela Costa has appreciated approximately 10% year-on-year, suggesting solid long-term value retention. At €3,011/m², this property is priced premium for quality but remains 35% below comparable Costa Blanca North properties. Rental potential (€800/week) provides income generation. However, purchase should balance investment returns against genuine personal enjoyment—the best investment is one you're genuinely happy to own regardless of appreciation."
