    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders eigendom kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Non-residents can purchase property in Spain without restrictions, though additional paperwork and a Spanish tax number (NIE) are required. Many UK and international buyers own holiday homes throughout Costa Blanca. Legal processes are straightforward with proper guidance from a Spanish property lawyer, typically costing 6-8% of purchase price in fees and taxes. Most buyers complete purchases within 4-6 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten om eigendom te kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect 6-8% in additional costs: 3% transfer tax, 1.2% notary fees, 1% registration fees, and legal fees typically around 0.5-1%.

      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers can obtain mortgages in Spain, typically 70-80% of property value. Interest rates are competitive (currently 3-4%).

Some prefer cash purchases to avoid currency complications and bureaucracy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van levensonderhoud aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca offers exceptional value compared to Northern Europe. Groceries cost 20-30% less than UK prices, restaurants range from €8-15 for casual meals to €30-50 upscale, and utilities average €80-120 monthly.

    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca geschikt voor gepensioneerden?",
      "answer": "Excellent. Costa Blanca attracts thousands of retirees annually, particularly from Northern Europe. The warm climate eliminates harsh winters, healthcare is affordable and high-quality, and the cost of living stretches retirement savings significantly. Established expat communities provide social connection, English is widely spoken, and the relaxed pace suits retirement perfectly. Sunshine, beaches, and Mediterranean lifestyle make it ideal for active retirees seeking adventure rather than isolation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoeveel bedraagt de onroerende voorheffing in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Annual property tax (IBI) on a €290,000 property typically ranges €200-400 yearly, varying by municipality. Non-residents pay additional wealth tax (0.2-2.5%) on property value, though some regions offer exemptions. Rental income is taxed as ordinary income (19-45% depending on total earnings). Spanish tax advisors help minimize liability through proper structure. Overall tax burden remains modest compared to most European countries, especially given low property values."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe is het weer aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Exceptional. San Javier enjoys 300+ days of annual sunshine with Mediterranean climate. Summer temperatures reach 28-32°C (82-90°F) with low humidity thanks to sea breezes. Winters are mild (8-15°C / 46-59°F) with occasional rain but rarely freezing. Spring and autumn offer perfect temperatures (18-25°C). The Mar Menor lagoon moderates coastal temperatures, creating one of Spain's most stable, pleasant climates—ideal for year-round holiday use and outdoor living."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe ver is de Costa Blanca van België?",
      "answer": "Alicante Airport is 45 minutes from San Javier with direct flights to London, Manchester, and other UK cities. Flight times are typically 2-2.5 hours. Budget airlines make regular travel affordable (€30-80 return). Many holiday home owners maintain a routine of monthly or quarterly visits, easily managing their properties while enjoying frequent escapes to sunshine. The proximity makes Costa Blanca ideal for part-time residency combining UK and Spanish living."
