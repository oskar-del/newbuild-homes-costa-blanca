    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten om eigendom te kopen in Spanje?",

Interest rates are competitive (typically 3-4% for 20-year terms). You'll need a Spanish tax number (NIE) and possibly Spanish employment or income documentation. Many foreign buyers work with international mortgage brokers who specialize in Spanish property finance. Currency exchange rates should be considered carefully."
