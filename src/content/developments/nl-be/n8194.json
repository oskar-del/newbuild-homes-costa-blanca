  "areaSection": "Villajoyosa is a coastal municipality in southern Alicante province, positioned 30km south of Benidorm along Spain's Mediterranean coastline. The town's distinctive colored buildings and compact urban layout create a unique Mediterranean character that attracts millions of annual visitors. The area experiences a pleasant Mediterranean climate with 300+ sunny days yearly, warm winters averaging 15°C, and summers reaching 28-30°C. Geography favors year-round tourism: sheltered coves, multiple Blue Flag beaches, and proximity to hiking in the Sierra Helada create seasonal diversity. The Costa Blanca's consistent growth trajectory stems from reliable weather, established expat infrastructure, and strategic positioning between major European markets.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Villajoyosa centers on beach culture, local markets, and international community integration. The established expat population means English is widely spoken, simplifying banking, healthcare, and day-to-day transactions. The Pueblo area offers authentic Mediterranean living—farmers markets on weekday mornings, tapas bars along narrow streets, and genuine Spanish social rhythms alongside international amenities. Beach proximity enables morning swims and evening paseos within minutes. Healthcare access includes the regional hospital and English-speaking private clinics. Shopping combines traditional markets (Consum, Lidl, Mercadona) with specialized food shops. The international community organizes social groups, sports activities, and cultural events year-round, creating natural networks for new residents.",
  "investmentSection": "This property aligns with Costa Blanca's documented investment fundamentals.

The 1-bedroom configuration attracts budget-conscious tourists and business travelers, minimizing vacancy. Property taxes remain favorable: IBI (property tax) typically €200-300 annually, while capital gains taxation offers favorable treatment for EU residents. With gross rental yields approaching 12-14% before expenses, combined with capital appreciation, this represents a balanced income-and-growth investment.",
  "conclusion": "This €249,000 apartment in Villajoyosa represents a disciplined investment entry point into the Costa Blanca market. The combination of strong rental fundamentals, below-market pricing relative to comparable Spanish properties, consistent capital appreciation, and minimal management overhead creates compelling financial metrics. The Pueblo location ensures immediate appeal to holiday renters while supporting personal use flexibility. For investors building diversified European property portfolios, this apartment delivers predictable income streams and inflation-protected appreciation.
