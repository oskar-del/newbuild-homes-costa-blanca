  "areaSection": "Calpe, perched on the Costa Blanca's northern coastline, is a vibrant Mediterranean town renowned for its iconic Peñón d'Ifach—a dramatic 332-meter limestone rock formation that defines the skyline and creates some of Spain's most photographed vistas. The town enjoys over 300 days of annual sunshine, with mild winters and warm summers that invite year-round outdoor living. Arenal Bol, where this penthouse is located, sits at the heart of Calpe's tourist and residential district, offering the perfect blend of lively beach culture and residential tranquility. The area's Blue Flag beaches, including the namesake Arenal-Bol, guarantee pristine waters and excellent facilities. Calpe's strategic position between Valencia (90 minutes) and Alicante (60 minutes) makes it easily accessible while maintaining its charming, established character. The town has evolved from a fishing village into a cosmopolitan destination without sacrificing its authentic Spanish soul, making it exceptionally attractive to international buyers seeking genuine Mediterranean living rather than over-developed resort areas.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Life in Calpe revolves around the perfect Mediterranean rhythm. Your mornings might begin with fresh churros from a local panadería, followed by a beach walk along Arenal-Bol's promenade where the Peñón towers above. The strong British and German expat community means English is widely spoken, easing integration while maintaining Spanish authenticity in quieter moments. Weekly markets brim with local produce—artisan cheeses, fresh seafood, and vibrant vegetables that define Mediterranean cuisine. Restaurant culture thrives here, from beachfront chiringuitos serving paella with your feet in sand to intimate tapas bars tucked into old town corners. Healthcare is excellent with English-speaking doctors readily available, and the upcoming tram connection will revolutionize getting around. The pace is refreshingly civilized: leisurely long lunches, afternoon siestas that the climate demands, and evenings spent on terraces as the sun melts into the sea. Yet Calpe isn't sleepy—cultural events, golf courses, water sports, and day trips to nearby Jávea or Altea keep life vibrant. For holiday home owners, this means your property becomes a genuine lifestyle upgrade, not just a investment, where every season feels like an extended vacation.",
