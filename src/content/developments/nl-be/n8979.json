  "metaDescription": "Exclusief 4-bedroom villa in Parque Andromeda, Pilar de La Horadada. Premium specification at €3,245/m² – 40% less than Spanish islands. 50 images.",
  "heroIntro": "Welcome to an exceptional opportunity in one of Costa Blanca's most discerning communities. This premium 4-bedroom villa in Parque Andromeda represents the pinnacle of contemporary Spanish coastal living, priced at €369,900 – a sophisticated investment that positions itself 40% below comparable Spanish island markets while maintaining uncompromising quality standards. The property, situated in the prestigious enclave of Pilar de La Horadada, offers discerning buyers a rare convergence of affordability and exclusivity. With 114m² of meticulously designed living space across a 128m² plot, every square metre has been optimized for the refined lifestyle of international property investors and expatriates seeking authentic Mediterranean authenticity without compromise. This villa exemplifies the kind of value proposition that attracts sophisticated European buyers to the region – superior construction standards, strategic location advantages, and the substantial cost differential compared to island alternatives make this an intellectually sound acquisition for those who demand both quality and prudent investment metrics.",
  "areaSection": "Pilar de La Horadada occupies a distinctive position along the Costa Blanca, bridging the gap between the bustling resort areas to the north and the quieter, more authentic Spanish towns to the south. Positioned in the province of Alicante, this municipality benefits from a Mediterranean climate characterised by 300+ days of sunshine annually, with mild winters (average 15°C) and warm summers (28-32°C). The town sits approximately 50km south of Alicante city and commands proximity to both the Murcia border and the pristine coastline. Unlike over-developed resort destinations, Pilar de La Horadada maintains a balanced character – genuinely Spanish in its infrastructure and community, yet profoundly international in its demographic composition. The elevation and positioning provides natural protection from excessive summer heat, whilst the established local amenities infrastructure reflects decades of thoughtful development rather than speculative construction.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Pilar de La Horadada unfolds at a measured, sophisticated pace that appeals to discerning expatriates and retirees seeking substance over spectacle. The established international community – predominantly British, Dutch, German, and Scandinavian residents – has created a genuinely cosmopolitan environment where English is widely spoken, healthcare professionals maintain international qualifications, and cultural exchanges occur organically rather than through tourism frameworks. Mornings might begin with visits to the excellent local markets, followed by café culture that echoes Mediterranean authenticity. The town centre offers quality restaurants serving both Spanish regional cuisine and international preferences, avoiding the tourist-trap stereotypes prevalent in nearby resorts. Access to Blue Flag beaches within 20 minutes provides recreational variety without requiring resort-style crowding. The established expat infrastructure means practical matters – legal services, financial advice, healthcare navigation – are handled by professionals familiar with international buyer requirements. This is not a place of manufactured experience, but rather authentic integration into Spanish life with professional support networks already operational.",
  "investmentSection": "From an investment perspective, this villa presents compelling fundamentals that distinguish it from speculative coastal properties. The Costa Blanca market demonstrates +8% year-on-year appreciation, with Pilar de La Horadada particularly benefiting from increased international investor interest and infrastructure maturation. Rental potential averages €800 per week (€3,200 monthly) for short-term holiday lets, positioning the property within reach of positive cash-flow scenarios when owner-occupied time permits. The premium specification pricing at €3,245/m² significantly undercuts comparable Spanish island markets (Mallorca, Ibiza) by 40%, suggesting substantial appreciation potential as the region attracts discerning international buyers seeking value. Long-term demographic trends favour Pilar de La Horadada specifically – European retirees increasingly prioritise proximity to authentic Spanish communities over resort-style destinations, supporting sustained demand. The established expatriate infrastructure reduces acquisition risks compared to speculative developments, whilst the Parque Andromeda location within an established residential community provides stability and liquidity advantages.",
  "conclusion": "This villa in Parque Andromeda represents precisely the property that discerning international buyers identify through comprehensive market analysis – premium specification, authentic location, investment fundamentals, and genuine lifestyle potential converging at a price point that reflects genuine value rather than speculative premium. The established expatriate infrastructure, healthcare accessibility, and Mediterranean authenticity of Pilar de La Horadada distinguish this investment from conventional coastal resort properties.

    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders eigendom kopen in Spanje?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten om eigendom te kopen in Spanje?",

Financing costs and surveyor fees may add modestly. These represent transparent, standardised expenses compared to UK conveyancing, with no hidden surcharges common in other markets."

Interest rates remain competitive with UK equivalents, often lower."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van levensonderhoud aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Cost of living in Costa Blanca averages 25-35% below equivalent UK expenditure when utilities, groceries, healthcare, and dining are aggregated.

Healthcare and prescription costs represent particular savings advantages for retirees."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca geschikt voor gepensioneerden?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How far is Costa Blanca from the United Kingdom?",
      "answer": "Alicante Airport, 65km from Pilar de La Horadada, offers direct flights to London and UK regional airports with flight times of approximately 2.5 hours.

Rental income taxation follows standard Spanish progressive rates. These establish significantly lower ownership costs compared to UK council tax and property taxation frameworks."
