  "heroIntro": "This 83m² two-bedroom apartment in central Alicante represents a compelling investment opportunity in one of Spain's most dynamic coastal markets.

The municipality experiences a Mediterranean climate with 320+ days of annual sunshine, moderate winters, and warm summers—ideal conditions for tourism-driven rental markets. The city's strategic location provides 150km of pristine coastline, multiple Blue Flag beaches, and proximity to major regional amenities. Alicante's geographic position offers accessibility to international markets via Alicante-Elche Airport (9km away), making it attractive to British, German, and Scandinavian investors. The city blends historic charm—the Barrio Santa Cruz medieval quarter, Castle of Santa Bárbara—with modern urban development, waterfront promenades, and contemporary architecture. Infrastructure investments and EU funding have modernized transportation networks, making Alicante increasingly competitive within Mediterranean property markets.",
