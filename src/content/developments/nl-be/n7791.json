    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders eigendom kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, without restrictions. Non-EU citizens can acquire Spanish property identical to Spanish citizens, establishing residency through property ownership. EU citizens enjoy absolute property acquisition rights. The process requires NIE (tax identification) number registration, property surveyor assessment, and notary documentation. Legal representation is standard but not mandatory."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten om eigendom te kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Beyond purchase price, buyers should anticipate: 6-8% transfer tax (ITP), 1-2% notary and registry fees, 0.5-1% property survey costs, and legal representation approximately €1,500-€3,000. Total acquisition costs typically reach 8-11% above purchase price. Annual property tax (IBI) averages €600-€900, with community fees variable based on complex amenities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat is het huurinkomstenpotentieel van dit eigendom?",
      "answer": "This 3-bedroom apartment typically achieves €800/week holiday let rates on Costa Blanca, translating to €41,600 annualized at full occupancy or approximately €31,200 with conservative 60% utilization across summer-weighted seasonality.

      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers access Spanish mortgages through major banks including BBVA, Santander, and CaixaBank. Typical terms offer 20-30 year amortization at competitive rates (approximately 3.5-4.5%), with 70-80% loan-to-value ratios. Non-EU citizens require longer documentation processes and often pay marginally higher rates. Down payments of 20-30% accelerate approval timelines."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is this property 40% cheaper than Spanish islands?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca mainland positioning avoids island premium pricing despite offering identical Mediterranean climate, beaches, and amenities. Baleares and Canaries command 40-50% price premiums due to limited supply and international brand positioning. El Verger's mainland location provides superior valuation entry with appreciation potential as tourism infrastructure continues developing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca een goede plek om eigendom te kopen?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca ranks among Europe's strongest property investment regions, demonstrating consistent 8% annual appreciation, established rental infrastructure, and dense expat communities.

      "answer": "Monthly living costs in El Verger average €1,200-€1,800 for comfortable single occupancy or €1,800-€2,400 for couples, including housing, utilities, food, and leisure activities. Supermarket costs run 20-30% below UK pricing; dining out averages €10-€15 for quality meals. Healthcare through Spanish system costs approximately €300 annually for EU residents; private insurance ranges €100-€200 monthly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far is Costa Blanca from UK?",

Alicante-Elche Airport provides year-round direct connections to London, Manchester, and Birmingham, with budget carriers offering frequent seasonal routes. Ferry/drive combinations require 24+ hours, making aviation the practical transport option."
