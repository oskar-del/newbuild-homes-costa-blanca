Whether you're relocating from the UK, Netherlands, or elsewhere in Europe, San Fulgencio's established expat community means you'll find English speakers, familiar amenities, and a welcoming environment for your family. The property's strong investment fundamentals (area trending +8% annually) make this both a wonderful home and a smart financial decision.",
  "areaSection": "San Fulgencio is a charming inland town in southern Alicante, just 15 minutes from the coast yet offering authentic Spanish village character without tourist overcrowding. Positioned between Alicante city and the famous beaches of Costa Blanca, it benefits from warm Mediterranean climate year-round—average temperatures around 18°C in winter and 28°C in summer. The town sits elevated with natural protection, making it cooler than beachfront areas. San Fulgencio has transformed over the past decade into a thriving residential community, attracting young families and retirees alike. The landscape features palm-lined streets, modern infrastructure mixed with traditional Spanish architecture, and a genuine sense of community. Being slightly inland means property prices remain reasonable while maintaining proximity to all coastal attractions. The town's development has been thoughtful and controlled, preserving green spaces and maintaining a safe, walkable environment.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in San Fulgencio revolves around family and community. Your children will attend excellent international schools teaching British curriculum just minutes away, while you enjoy morning coffee at local cafés where English is widely spoken. Shopping is convenient with Mercadona and Lidl supermarkets, plus authentic local markets where Spanish families gather. Healthcare is reassuring—private clinics with English-speaking doctors are nearby, and the regional hospital is just 30 minutes away. Weekends mean easy trips to Blue Flag beaches (20 minutes), championship golf courses, or exploring Alicante's cultural attractions. The established expat community creates a welcoming environment; you'll meet families in similar situations at international schools, sports clubs, and expat social groups. Public transport connects you to larger towns, though most families appreciate having a car for the flexibility to explore the region. Restaurants ranging from Spanish tapas bars to international cuisine cater to all tastes. The pace is relaxed but never dull—you get a genuine Spanish lifestyle without isolation.",
  "investmentSection": "From an investment perspective, this property demonstrates solid fundamentals. San Fulgencio's property market has grown 8% year-on-year, outpacing inflation and many other Spanish markets. At €2,523/m², the property sits above the area average (€2,200/m²) but commands premium pricing due to its condition and specifications—yet remains 40% cheaper than comparable properties on Mallorca or Ibiza. The rental market supports strong returns: similar 3-bedroom villas in the area achieve €800 per week during peak summer season, suggesting annual rental income potential of €30,000-€35,000 for families considering part-time rental. Whether you plan to live here full-time or combine personal use with holiday rentals, the property's location and specifications make it attractive to the growing number of families relocating to Costa Blanca. Property values have stabilized after the 2008 crisis, and the current market shows healthy demand from international buyers seeking better value than northern Spain or islands.",

Three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and 170m² of plot space give growing families room to thrive.

    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca een goede plek om eigendom te kopen?",
      "answer": "Yes, Costa Blanca remains one of Europe's most attractive property markets for families. The region combines affordability, climate, excellent healthcare, and established international communities. Property values have stabilized since 2008 and are trending upward (+8% in San Fulgencio). Unlike Spain's northern coast, it offers winter sunshine and lower heating costs. The combination of value, lifestyle, and investment potential makes it particularly compelling for UK families."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders eigendom kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Non-EU citizens can purchase property in Spain without restrictions, though you'll need a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and a Spanish bank account. EU citizens have identical rights to Spanish citizens. The process is straightforward with professional help: most buyers complete purchases within 2-3 months. Legal costs (around 8-10% of purchase price) cover lawyers, notary, and registration. British buyers represent the largest expat demographic in Costa Blanca."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten om eigendom te kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price of €275,000, expect these costs: notary fees (0.5-1% of price), property registration (0.5-1%), lawyer fees (€800-€1,500), and transfer tax (6-10% depending on region). Total acquisition costs typically run 8-10% of purchase price. For this property, that's approximately €22,000-€27,500 in additional costs. After purchase, annual property tax (IBI) is typically €300-€600, depending on valuation. No capital gains tax applies if you declare it your primary residence."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van levensonderhoud aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Cost of living is 25-35% lower than UK equivalents. Groceries, dining, utilities, and healthcare are significantly cheaper. This €275,000 property will cost approximately €1,200-€1,500 annually in property tax and insurance. Monthly utility costs (electricity, water, internet) typically run €100-€150. Dining out remains very affordable: three-course meal for two in local restaurant costs €35-€45. This affordability makes retirement or semi-retirement particularly attractive for working-age families."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan ik als buitenlander een hypotheek krijgen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers can obtain Spanish mortgages, typically up to 70-80% of purchase price with interest rates currently around 3-4%. You'll need a NIE (tax ID), employment verification, and income documentation. British buyers often find it easier than EU nationals due to pre-established lending relationships. Alternatively, some buyers bring capital from UK property sales or existing savings. A Spanish mortgage advisor can guide you through options—many speak English and understand UK banking history."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many bedrooms and bathrooms does this villa have?",
      "answer": "This property features 3 spacious bedrooms and 3 full bathrooms. This configuration eliminates compromises for families—each child can have their own bedroom, and morning bathroom queues become history. The three bathrooms also ensure visiting family members or guests have facilities without inconveniencing the household. Built area is 109m², providing generous space without excessive maintenance."

    {
      "question": "Is San Fulgencio a good place to raise a family?",
      "answer": "Excellent choice for families. San Fulgencio offers international schools (British curriculum options within 10 minutes), safe neighborhoods with controlled developments like El Oasis, English-speaking community support, and balanced lifestyle. Climate is healthy year-round (mild winters, sunny summers). You get authentic Spanish living without isolation or language barriers. Many families report their children settling in quickly, making bilingual friends, and thriving in the welcoming international community."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far is this property from beaches?",
      "answer": "20 minutes by car to multiple Blue Flag beaches including Playa Centro and Guardamar's waterfront. The location offers perfect balance: daily coastal access without beachfront prices or tourist-area parking headaches. Children can enjoy family beach days frequently without beach property premium costs (40% savings vs. beachfront villas). Summer weekends mean quick trips for swimming, water sports, or beach picnics."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the rental income potential of this property?",
      "answer": "Similar 3-bedroom villas in San Fulgencio achieve €800 per week during peak season (June-September), suggesting annual rental income of €30,000-€35,000 if fully rented. Many families let properties 3-4 months annually (covering property costs) while retaining personal use.
