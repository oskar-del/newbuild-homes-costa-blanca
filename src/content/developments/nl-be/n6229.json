  "metaTitle": "4-Bed Apartment €499k Playa Flamenca - Investeringsmogelijkheid",
  "metaDescription": "4-bedroom apartment Orihuela Costa €499,000. Premium specification, 35% below Costa Blanca Noord prices. Strong rental potential.",
  "heroIntro": "This 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Playa Flamenca represents a compelling investment opportunity in one of Spain's most sought-after coastal markets. Priced at €499,000 (€4,193/m²), this property offers premium specification at 35% less than comparable properties in Costa Blanca North, presenting exceptional value for discerning investors. With Orihuela Costa experiencing consistent +10% year-on-year appreciation, combined with strong holiday rental demand averaging €800 per week, this apartment is positioned for both capital growth and reliable passive income. The 119m² layout maximizes rental appeal with four generous bedrooms, making it ideal for family holiday lets and long-term rental portfolios. For investors seeking exposure to Spain's thriving coastal property market without premium North Coast pricing, this property delivers measurable returns and growth potential. The location within Playa Flamenca provides direct access to beaches, golf courses, and a well-established expat community, ensuring consistent tenant demand and sustained appreciation.",
  "areaSection": "Orihuela Costa stretches along 14 kilometers of Mediterranean coastline in southern Alicante, characterized by golden beaches, pine forests, and a temperate climate averaging 300+ sunny days annually. Geographically positioned between Torrevieja and Guardamar, the area combines coastal resort amenities with authentic Spanish charm. The region's elevation provides sea views from many properties while maintaining protection from extreme weather. Playa Flamenca specifically developed as a planned community with infrastructure designed for modern living, featuring wide avenues, organized beach access, and integrated leisure facilities. The area's strategic location offers proximity to Alicante Airport (50km) while remaining distinct from overcrowded tourist zones, creating a balanced environment for both residents and holiday visitors.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Orihuela Costa centers around beach culture, golf, and an international community where English is widely spoken. The established British, Scandinavian, and Dutch expat communities have created vibrant social networks, restaurants serving diverse cuisines, and English-language services throughout the area. Mornings might begin with breakfast at beachfront cafés at La Zenia or Playa Flamenca beaches, while afternoons offer golf at world-class courses like Villamartín Golf Club minutes away. Weekly markets provide fresh produce and local specialties, while modern supermarkets (Mercadona, Consum, Lidl) stock international brands. The expat infrastructure means English-speaking doctors, dentists, and service providers are readily available. Evening entertainment ranges from traditional Spanish tapas bars to contemporary restaurants. Property owners benefit from a rental market fueled by holiday makers seeking authentic Mediterranean experiences without northern European price points.",
  "investmentSection": "Investment fundamentals strongly support this property acquisition. Orihuela Costa has delivered consistent +10% annual appreciation over the past five years, with forecasts indicating continued growth as infrastructure improvements and EU funding projects advance regional development. The rental market demonstrates proven demand: comparable 4-bedroom properties command €700-900 per week in peak season (June-September) with steady mid-season occupancy (€500-700). Conservative annual projections suggest 20-24 weeks of rental at €800/week generate €16,000-19,200 gross rental income. At €499,000 purchase price, this yields 3.2-3.8% gross annual returns, typical for premium Mediterranean properties. Capital appreciation potential adds substantial upside: a conservative 5-7% annual appreciation projects €25,000-35,000 annual capital gains. The 35% pricing discount versus Costa Blanca North properties provides entry value while maintaining exposure to the same market dynamics driving broader Costa Blanca growth.",
  "conclusion": "This €499,000 4-bedroom apartment in Playa Flamenca represents a strategically positioned investment opportunity combining capital appreciation potential with proven rental income streams. The 35% pricing advantage versus Costa Blanca North properties, coupled with +10% annual market appreciation and €800/week rental demand, creates measurable returns within established Mediterranean markets. The property's premium specification and optimal 4-bedroom layout maximize holiday lettings appeal while minimizing vacancy periods.
