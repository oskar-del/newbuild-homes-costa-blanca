  "heroIntro": "This 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Mutxamel represents a compelling investment opportunity on Spain's Costa Blanca. Priced at €350,750, it offers exceptional value at €3,813/m² — 40% less than comparable properties on Spanish island markets, yet featuring premium specifications. For investment-focused buyers, the fundamentals are strong: Mutxamel sits in a high-demand rental market with consistent tourism throughout the year.
