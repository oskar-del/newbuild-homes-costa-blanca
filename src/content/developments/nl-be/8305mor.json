  "areaSection": "Moraira occupies a privileged position on Costa Blanca's northern coast, nestled between dramatic rocky outcrops and crystalline Mediterranean waters. This small, upmarket village sits approximately 100km south of Valencia and benefits from a micro-climate that delivers over 300 days of sunshine annually. Unlike busier coastal towns, Moraira has maintained its character through selective development and strong community values. The area is renowned for its natural beauty—rocky coves alternate with golden beaches, while inland, pine forests and white villages provide stunning backdrops. Benimeit specifically sits on elevated terrain offering exceptional views across the Mediterranean and towards the inland mountains. The region's geology creates natural amphitheaters of rock and sea, making every sunset memorable. This corner of Costa Blanca enjoys cooler summers than further south and milder winters, creating an ideal year-round climate. The proximity to both Valencia and Alicante airports ensures easy access while maintaining the village's tranquil atmosphere.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Life in Moraira revolves around quality rather than quantity. Days flow between beachside drinks at chiringuitos, leisurely lunches in family-run restaurants, and afternoon pursuits like golf at nearby championship courses. The Friday market brings locals and visitors together for fresh produce, crafts, and community connection. You'll find a sophisticated, multi-generational expat community—primarily British, German, and Dutch families who've chosen this village as their permanent or seasonal base. English is widely spoken, international schools are accessible, and English-speaking healthcare is readily available, removing typical expat concerns. The atmosphere feels refined and understated; this isn't party tourism but rather a place where people genuinely relish Mediterranean living. Local restaurants serve both traditional paella and international cuisine, many family-owned across generations. The beaches—El Portet with its Blue Flag status, Playa de l'Ampolla, and hidden coves like Cala Andrago—offer swimming, snorkeling, and water sports. Summer evenings bring open-air cinema, art exhibitions, and cultural events without the commercialism of larger resorts.",
  "investmentSection": "This land represents a strategic investment in one of Costa Blanca's most appreciating markets. The Moraira property market has shown consistent growth of approximately 5% year-on-year, outpacing broader Spanish coastal trends. At €350,000, this plot is positioned at the area's average price—€3,800 per square meter—offering excellent value relative to similar properties in Mallorca, which command 25% premiums for comparable locations. For investors considering rental potential, completed properties in Moraira typically generate €1,600 per week during peak season (7-night rentals), suggesting strong income possibilities. The sophisticated buyer demographic—wealthy European professionals seeking second homes—ensures stable demand and premium rental rates. Land in this location offers dual potential: personal enjoyment as a holiday residence combined with appreciation and rental income. The limited development permissions in Moraira naturally constrain supply, supporting long-term value growth. This property appeals to investors seeking Mediterranean exposure without the volatility of purely speculative real estate markets.",
