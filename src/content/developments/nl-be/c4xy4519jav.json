  "areaSection": "Javea, nestled on the eastern Costa Blanca between Benidorm and Denia, commands one of Spain's most coveted coastal locations. This charming Mediterranean town benefits from a micro-climate creating over 320 days of sunshine annually, with temperate winters and warm summers moderated by sea breezes. The geography is distinctive—dramatic rocky promontories frame pristine coves alongside sandy Blue Flag beaches, creating a landscape of natural beauty rarely found in over-developed resort areas. Rafalet, the northern residential sector, represents Javea's most prestigious neighbourhood, characterised by lower building density, mountain vistas, and proximity to the town's cultural heart. The area has evolved into an international enclave whilst maintaining its authentic Spanish charm, with local markets, traditional restaurants, and contemporary amenities coexisting harmoniously.",
