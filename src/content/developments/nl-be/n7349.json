  "areaSection": "Dolores is a charming inland town in southern Alicante, positioned strategically between the leisure coast and inland Murcia. The town enjoys year-round Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually, hot, dry summers, and mild winters perfect for holiday escapes. The surrounding landscape blends agriculture—this region is famous for its vineyards and citrus groves—with modern residential developments designed for international buyers. Dolores' elevation and location create refreshing sea breezes during summer months, naturally cooling the area compared to coastal developments. The town itself maintains Spanish authenticity with local weekly markets, family-run restaurants, and a genuine sense of community, while remaining just 20 minutes from pristine beaches and world-class amenities.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Dolores centers around Spanish tradition meets international comfort. The established expat community—primarily British, German, and Dutch residents—means English is widely spoken, making navigation, healthcare, and social integration seamless. Mornings might involve a coffee at a local café watching the main square come alive with market vendors. Afternoons could include trips to nearby Blue Flag beaches, championship golf courses at Vistabella or Las Ramblas, or exploring authentic paella restaurants in neighboring towns. The region's excellent healthcare, international schools with British curriculum options, and modern supermarkets (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum) ensure you're never far from home comforts. Weekend drives take you to Torrevieja's lagoons, Orihuela's historical sites, or up the coast toward Alicante. It's the lifestyle of leisure without sacrificing practicality.",
  "investmentSection": "Beyond personal enjoyment, this property represents solid investment fundamentals. Costa Blanca's property market is appreciating at 8% annually, with Dolores positioned at the heart of this growth corridor.

Holiday rental demand is robust—typical 7-night bookings in the region command €800-€1,000, suggesting strong short-term income potential. Unlike Spanish island properties where saturation limits rental returns, Dolores remains underdeveloped for tourism, offering first-mover advantages. Whether you rent seasonally while enjoying it personally, or commit to full-time rental management, the combination of reasonable acquisition cost, growing demand, and Mediterranean lifestyle appeal creates compelling return potential.",
