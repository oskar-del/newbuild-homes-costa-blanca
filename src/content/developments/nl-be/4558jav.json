  "areaSection": "Javea, nestled on the northern Costa Blanca within the province of Alicante, occupies a privileged position on Spain's eastern Mediterranean coast. This whitewashed town of approximately 29,000 residents sits between dramatic rocky headlands, creating a distinctive geography that distinguishes it from neighbouring developments. The region experiences a temperate Mediterranean climate with 300+ days of sunshine annually, mild winters averaging 12°C, and warm summers moderated by sea breezes. The Montgó mountain dominates the landscape, offering dramatic vistas and excellent hiking opportunities. Javea's appeal derives from its preservation of authentic Spanish character while accommodating a sophisticated international community.
