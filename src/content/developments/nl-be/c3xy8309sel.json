For discerning buyers seeking premium properties in Spain, this villa offers compelling value, positioned significantly below regional averages while commanding panoramic open, sea, and mountain views that define the Costa Blanca lifestyle.\n\nPedreguer has emerged as the destination for affluent international buyers who appreciate refined living without the overexposed glamour of Spain's most crowded coastal zones.

With 42 professional images documenting every detail, this property showcases the caliber of finishes and location advantages that justify premium positioning in today's market.\n\nThe €850,000 asking price reflects exceptional market positioning—at par with Pedreguer's €2,200/m² average while offering the lifestyle benefits of established Mediterranean communities. In a market trending upward at 8% annually, this villa represents both immediate living satisfaction and sound investment potential for buyers seeking Costa Blanca authenticity.",
  "areaSection": "Pedreguer occupies a strategic position along Costa Blanca's northern reaches, nestled between the Mediterranean and the dramatic inland terrain that characterizes the Marina Baixa region. This municipality of approximately 5,000 residents maintains an authentic Spanish character while hosting a substantial international community. The area experiences a coveted Mediterranean climate with 320+ days of sunshine annually, mild winters (rarely below 8°C), and summers moderated by sea breezes. Geographically, Pedreguer benefits from proximity to both nature—the Montgó mountain backdrop and nearby Pego marshlands—and civilized amenities. The town sits 55km south of Alicante, positioning residents within easy reach of the region's principal airport while maintaining rural tranquility. This balance between accessibility and seclusion attracts buyers seeking genuine Mediterranean living rather than tourist-oriented developments.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Pedreguer centers on a deliberately paced Mediterranean rhythm that appeals to discerning international residents. The established expat community—particularly British, German, and Scandinavian residents—has created sophisticated social infrastructure: English-speaking healthcare providers, international dining options, and cultural activities reflecting the area's cosmopolitan character. Mercadona, Lidl, and Consum supermarkets provide daily essentials, while the region's renowned Friday markets offer fresh local produce and regional specialties. Healthcare access includes a regional hospital within 30 minutes and private clinics with English-speaking doctors. Beach culture dominates summer months—multiple Blue Flag beaches lie 20 minutes away by car. Golf enthusiasts access several championship courses within the immediate region, while the town's position between Jávea and Denia offers proximity to Spain's most celebrated culinary scenes. For residents prioritizing both comfort and genuine community, Pedreguer delivers the Mediterranean lifestyle without the pretension of over-developed coastal enclaves.",
  "investmentSection": "Property values in the Pedreguer-Marina Baixa region are appreciating at 8% annually—outpacing broader Spanish averages as international demand for authentic Mediterranean communities intensifies. This €850,000 villa reflects attractive entry positioning into a market trending decisively upward. Rental potential reinforces investment credentials: comparable properties in the region command €800 per week through short-term vacation lettings, suggesting annual gross rental yields of €35,000+ from seasonal markets alone. The Costa Blanca market—particularly the Alicante province—trades at approximately 40% discount to Spanish island properties (Balearics, Canaries), positioning mainland villas as superior value for both owner-occupation and rental strategies. Established expat communities provide stable tenant bases for long-term lettings, while the tourism infrastructure supports vacation rental models. For investors seeking Mediterranean exposure with limited currency fluctuation risk (Euro-denominated) and reasonable liquidity, Pedreguer offers compelling fundamentals absent from more speculative markets.",
