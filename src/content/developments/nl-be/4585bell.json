    {
      "question": "Kunnen buitenlanders eigendom kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, non-residents and non-citizens can purchase property in Spain without restriction. You'll need a Spanish tax identification number (NIE), though the purchase process remains straightforward with professional legal guidance. EU citizens enjoy additional rights under residency regulations, whilst non-EU buyers navigate identical property purchase procedures with slightly extended administrative timelines."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten om eigendom te kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Acquisition costs total approximately 8-10% of purchase price, comprising: 3% legal fees, 1% real estate agent commission, 3-4% stamp duty and regional taxes, and 1-2% notary and registration fees. Additional considerations include potential Spanish mortgage arrangement fees (0.5-1%) if financing, and approximately €100-200 annually for property ownership tax (IBI). These costs appear substantial initially but align with Western European standards."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wat zijn de kosten van levensonderhoud aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Cost of living on the Costa Blanca remains substantially lower than Northern Europe, typically 20-30% below UK levels. Monthly expenses for individuals vary based on lifestyle: €1,200-1,500 supports modest independent living, €2,000-2,500 enables comfortable circumstances with dining and leisure, whilst €3,500+ provides affluent standards. Property ownership costs (utilities, maintenance, taxes) remain moderate compared to Northern European equivalents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is de Costa Blanca geschikt voor gepensioneerden?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca ranks among Europe's premier retirement destinations. The region offers consistent Mediterranean climate, healthcare infrastructure exceeding many home countries, established expatriate communities reducing relocation isolation, affordable living costs extending retirement income, and recreational amenities supporting active aging.

    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe ver is de Costa Blanca van België?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca averages approximately 1,200-1,300 kilometers from the UK mainland, requiring 2-3 hours direct flight time from major UK airports. Alicante International Airport provides daily connections from London, Manchester, and regional UK bases, making frequent travel feasible. Ferry alternatives via France require 24-36 hours, though air travel dominates for regular UK visitors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hoe is het weer aan de Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys Mediterranean climate with approximately 300+ annual sunshine days.

    },
    {
      "question": "Kan ik als buitenlander een hypotheek krijgen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "Yes, major Spanish and international banks provide mortgages to non-resident property buyers. Typical financing covers 60-80% of purchase price, requiring proof of income, credit history assessment, and property valuation. Interest rates remain competitive with Northern European markets; expect slightly longer approval timelines (4-6 weeks) compared to domestic borrowing. Professional mortgage brokers specializing in expatriate finance simplify application procedures."
    },
    {
      "question": "Heb ik een visum nodig om eigendom te kopen in Spanje?",
      "answer": "No, property purchase doesn't require visa documentation. However, acquiring a tax identification number (NIE) necessitates brief administrative processing through Spanish authorities or Spanish consulates in your home country. EU citizens enjoy simplified residency pathways, whilst non-EU nationals can establish legal property ownership without formal residency, though extended stays may trigger visa requirements handled separately from property acquisition."
