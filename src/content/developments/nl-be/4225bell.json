The microclimate benefits from Mediterranean conditions with 300+ days of sunshine annually, while the elevated position provides cooler summers than beachfront areas. The village maintains a peaceful character despite strong international investment, with the Cumbre del Sol development representing modern residential expansion. Road access is excellent, with the N-332 coast road providing connectivity to Alicante Airport (90 minutes), Valencia (120 minutes), and regional amenities.

However, if you intend to reside in Spain more than 90 days annually, you must obtain residency permits (temporary or permanent). Post-Brexit UK citizens obtain residency through various pathways (property ownership, retirement, employment). Legal advice is recommended for individual circumstances, but property acquisition itself carries no visa requirements."
