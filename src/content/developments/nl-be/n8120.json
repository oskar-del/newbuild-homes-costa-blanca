The town balances developed infrastructure with authentic Mediterranean character—commanding exceptional views across the Mediterranean from elevated positions, while maintaining proximity to both cultural attractions and natural reserves. Situated approximately 40km south of Alicante International Airport, Finestrat benefits from Mediterranean climate conditions: consistently mild winters (average 8-12°C) and warm summers (average 25-28°C), with over 300 sunshine days annually.\n\nThe geography offers distinct advantages: elevated locations provide sea views and natural cooling breezes, while the proximity to the Puig Campana mountain creates a dramatic landscape backdrop.

Equally significant, the property sits 40% below Spanish island markets (Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza), offering Mediterranean lifestyle at mainland pricing.\n\nRental income potential supports investment thesis: comparable Finestrat properties achieve €800+ per week during peak season (June-September), with shoulder seasons generating €500-600 weekly returns. Annual rental yields of 7-9% are achievable through professional management. The demographic profile—affluent European retirees, British expatriates, and holiday seekers—ensures consistent demand. Infrastructure development and airport connectivity continue driving market fundamentals, while the international community provides ongoing tenant sourcing for rental operations.",

      "answer": "Absolutely. EU and non-EU citizens enjoy equal property ownership rights in Spain.

      "question": "Heb ik een visum nodig om eigendom te kopen in Spanje?",
