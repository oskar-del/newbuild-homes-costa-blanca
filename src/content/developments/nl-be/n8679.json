This beautifully presented 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Lomas de Cabo Roig offers the perfect foundation for a relaxed, peaceful retirement on Spain's Costa Blanca. Priced at €186,500, you're acquiring premium specification at exceptional value—35% less than comparable properties in Costa Blanca North—making this an intelligent choice for discerning retirees seeking quality without excess cost.\n\nOrihuela Costa has become synonymous with authentic expat living, where thousands of retirees from Britain, Scandinavia, and Northern Europe have built thriving communities. The year-round Mediterranean sunshine, world-class healthcare, and vibrant social scene create an environment where life genuinely feels easier. Your 69m² home sits within a well-established neighbourhood known for accessibility and neighbourhood character—no pretension, just genuine quality of life.\n\nAt €2,703 per square metre, this apartment reflects the area's growing reputation.

Whether you're planning permanent relocation or a sophisticated investment property, this represents genuine value in one of Spain's most sought-after retirement destinations.",
  "areaSection": "Lomas de Cabo Roig sits within Orihuela Costa, a carefully developed beachside community stretching 12 kilometres along the Alicante coastline. Unlike the high-rise developments of decades past, this area emphasizes quality infrastructure, mature landscaping, and genuine community infrastructure. The microclimate here is exceptionally stable—300+ days of sunshine annually, with temperatures rarely exceeding 35°C or dropping below 8°C. The proximity to both the Mediterranean Sea and the scenic La Zenia Boulevard shopping district creates natural boundaries that define daily life. You're 50 minutes from Alicante airport, yet far enough removed from urban pressures. The terrain is relatively flat with good road connectivity, and the area benefits from ongoing investment in healthcare facilities and services tailored specifically to international residents.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Orihuela Costa revolves around genuine community rather than tourist infrastructure. You'll find yourself naturally connecting with neighbours at weekly markets, beach promenades, or one of the numerous chiringuitos (beachside restaurants) serving excellent paella and fresh seafood. The established expat networks mean English is genuinely widely spoken—practical matters like healthcare, legal advice, and administration don't require language skills. Beach access is immediate; La Zenia's Blue Flag beach is 10 minutes away, ideal for morning walks. Restaurants range from authentic Spanish tapas bars to international cuisine reflecting the international population. The slower pace suits retirement perfectly—there's no pressure to rush anywhere. Golf enthusiasts discover Villamartín golf course practically on their doorstep, with four additional championship courses within 30 minutes. Healthcare worries dissolve with multiple English-speaking medical centres and two major hospitals minutes away.",
  "investmentSection": "Beyond personal enjoyment, this apartment represents sound financial planning. Orihuela Costa has experienced consistent 10% year-on-year price appreciation as infrastructure improves and international awareness grows. The €186,500 purchase price sits strategically below area averages (€2,100/m² area average versus €2,703/m² here reflects premium specification), yet rental potential remains strong—comparable 2-bedroom apartments command €800 per week in peak season. For retirees, this means either securing your dream home at fair value or creating a revenue-generating asset that funds ongoing expenses. Unlike speculative coastal properties, demand here is fundamentally driven by genuine residents and long-term relocations, not tourism volatility. The 35% discount to Costa Blanca North properties reflects value, not inferior quality—simply smarter pricing for savvy buyers who've researched thoroughly.",
  "conclusion": "This apartment in Lomas de Cabo Roig represents more than property purchase—it's a gateway to proven Mediterranean retirement living where thousands have already discovered genuine quality of life. At €186,500 with premium specification, you're acquiring smart value in a neighbourhood showing consistent appreciation and strong rental potential. The combination of year-round sunshine, excellent healthcare, established expat communities, and reasonable cost creates conditions where retirement genuinely feels easier and more enjoyable. Whether planning permanent relocation or creating an investment asset, this represents a decision you'll appreciate for decades.
