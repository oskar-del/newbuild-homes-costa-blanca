This exceptional 2-bedroom bungalow in Hondón de las Nieves offers the perfect holiday home opportunity at just €136,900. What makes this property truly remarkable is the value: premium specification at 40% less than comparable properties on Spanish islands.

  "areaSection": "Hondón de las Nieves sits in the heart of Alicante Province, nestled in the Alcoiá valley where inland charm meets Mediterranean accessibility. This authentic Spanish village maintains its traditional character while welcoming an international community that appreciates genuine living away from overdeveloped coastal areas. The microclimate here is exceptional—protected by surrounding hills, you benefit from abundant sunshine while avoiding the extreme heat of purely coastal locations. The region is known for its agricultural heritage, with local markets still selling produce from family farms. Geography works in your favour: you're close enough to beaches for weekend adventures (20 minutes to Blue Flag beaches), yet far enough inland to experience quieter, more authentic Spanish living. The elevation provides cooling breezes and spectacular views across the valleys.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Hondón de las Nieves flows at a Mediterranean rhythm that reminds you why you wanted a holiday home here. The established expatriate community means you'll find English spoken widely, yet you're living authentically among Spanish families and long-term residents who genuinely love this area. Mornings might start at the local café with proper Spanish coffee, followed by shopping at Mercadona or the weekly markets bursting with fresh produce. Healthcare is excellent—regional hospitals are 30 minutes away with English-speaking doctors readily available, which matters when you're spending extended periods here. The restaurant scene surprises visitors: small, family-run establishments serve regional specialties at prices that won't drain your holiday budget. International schools operate in the region for those bringing families. Come evening, the pace slows further—this is where you actually relax, not perform vacation activities. You'll find yourself adopting the local rhythm, discovering that your 'getaway' has become genuinely restorative.",
  "investmentSection": "This property isn't just a lifestyle choice—it's a financially intelligent acquisition. Hondón de las Nieves has appreciated 8% year-on-year, outpacing many coastal areas as savvy buyers recognize the value proposition. At €2,320 per square meter, you're acquiring a property with premium specification at 40% below what you'd pay for comparable properties on Spanish islands. The rental market validates this: holiday rental agencies typically charge €800 per week (€3,200 monthly during summer), meaning your property could offset holding costs through just 5-6 weeks of seasonal rentals annually. Property taxes in Spain are reasonable for non-resident holiday home owners, and the real estate landscape here continues strengthening as flight infrastructure improves and remote workers discover the area. Whether you hold for personal enjoyment or develop modest rental income, you're investing in a location with genuine fundamentals, not speculation-driven pricing.",
