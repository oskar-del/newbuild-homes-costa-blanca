  "investmentSection": "This apartment presents a quantifiable investment case in a market demonstrating strong fundamentals. Santa Pola's 8% year-on-year appreciation trend outpaces Spanish national averages, driven by increasing European demand and limited new supply. At €4,175/m², this property trades at a 40% discount to comparable Spanish island markets (Balearics, Canaries), providing significant upside potential as Costa Blanca gains investment recognition. Typical weekly holiday rental rates for 3-bedroom apartments in Santa Pola average €800, generating €41,600 annually at 65% occupancy—a 10.3% gross rental yield before management costs. Long-term rental rates range €900-1,100 monthly, with consistent demand from northern European retirees and remote workers. The established expat community and English-speaking services reduce management complexity, enabling remote ownership.
