    {
      "question": "La Costa Blanca est-elle un bon endroit pour acheter un bien immobilier ?",

The region demonstrates consistent market appreciation (+8% year-on-year), established international communities, comprehensive healthcare and educational infrastructure, and exceptional climate conditions. Property values benefit from sustained demand, limited premium inventory, and strong rental income potential for holiday letting investments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Yes, non-residents and foreigners can purchase property in Spain without restrictions. No special permits are required; the process mirrors Spanish citizen transactions. However, foreigners must obtain a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and typically require legal representation to navigate documentation. Established conveyancing solicitors specializing in international purchases facilitate the entire process, ensuring compliance with Spanish property law and tax obligations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quels sont les frais d'achat d'un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, buyers typically allocate 6-8% for additional acquisition costs: transfer tax (6-10% depending on region), legal fees (0.5-1%), conveyancing charges (0.5%), and official registry fees (0.1%). Costa Blanca properties include urbanización community fees (typically €60-150 monthly) and property taxation. Annual costs include council tax (IBI) averaging €200-400 yearly. Professional legal guidance ensures transparent cost forecasting before purchase completion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel est le coût de la vie sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca offers excellent value compared to Northern European alternatives. Monthly living expenses for couples typically range €1,200-1,800, including rental accommodation, utilities, groceries, dining, and entertainment. Property owners eliminate rental costs; utilities average €100-150 monthly. Healthcare through private insurance costs €50-100 monthly. Dining and leisure expenses reflect Mediterranean pricing—significantly lower than UK or Northern Europe. Established expatriate communities provide cost-sharing networks and purchasing cooperatives reducing expenses further."
    },
    {
      "question": "Ai-je besoin d'un visa pour acheter un bien en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Purchasing property does not automatically grant residence visas. Non-EU citizens require appropriate visa sponsorship or residence permits separate from property ownership. UK citizens benefit from post-Brexit residency agreements permitting 90-day visits without visas; extended residency requires specific visa categories (retirement, professional, investment). Spanish authorities maintain streamlined processes for property investors; legal advisors guide visa navigation based on individual citizenship and residency intentions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Combien coûtent les taxes foncières en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Annual property taxation (IBI—Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles) averages 0.4-1.1% of cadastral value, typically €200-600 annually for properties in this price range. Transfer taxes at purchase average 6-10% depending on regional location; Costa Blanca properties experience 6% transfer taxation. Capital gains taxation applies if reselling within ten years, calculated on appreciation. Professional accountants advise on taxation strategy, available exemptions, and portfolio structuring to optimize international tax positioning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Puis-je obtenir un prêt hypothécaire en Espagne en tant qu'étranger ?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign purchasers can secure Spanish mortgages through established lenders. Most major banks offer financing up to 60-80% loan-to-value ratios for non-residents. Interest rates remain competitive, typically 2.5-4% for fixed-rate products. Lenders require proof of income, employment verification, and credit assessment. Many international purchasers benefit from multi-currency mortgages minimizing exchange rate exposure. Early engagement with mortgage specialists expedites approval processes and secures advantageous terms before property selection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far is Costa Blanca from UK?",
      "answer": "Alicante-Elche International Airport, forty-five minutes from Polop, operates multiple daily flights to London (Gatwick, Stansted, Luton) and Manchester, Bristol, and Edinburgh. Flight times average 2.5-3 hours. Budget airlines provide affordable options; premium carriers offer business-class connectivity. The established UK expatriate community facilitates ongoing social connections; many residents maintain dual residency balancing Mediterranean and British communities across seasons."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel temps fait-il sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys Mediterranean climate with approximately 300 annual sunshine days. Summer temperatures average 28-32°C (82-90°F) with low humidity; winter temperatures remain mild at 12-16°C (54-61°F). Polop's elevation (300m) provides natural cooling compared to coastal zones.
