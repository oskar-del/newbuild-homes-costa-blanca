    },
    {

      "answer": "€800 weekly (€3,200 monthly) represents typical 7-night holiday let rates in Aguilas' established rental market, delivering 9.9% gross yield. Net returns of 6-7% annually are achievable after professional management fees (15-20%), maintenance reserves, utilities, and cleaning costs.

    },
    {
      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners can purchase Spanish property without residency requirements or citizenship restrictions. Non-EU citizens require NIE (Spanish tax identification number) obtainable through local police or Spanish embassy offices. Banking requirements include Spanish bank account opening (facilitated by property purchase documentation). Inheritance and tax planning benefit from specialized legal counsel familiar with international property ownership protocols. Purchase timelines typically span 6-8 weeks from offer acceptance through completion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quels sont les frais d'achat d'un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Purchase costs in Spain typically total 10-12% above listed property prices. Transfer tax (ITP) ranges 6-8% depending on regional location. Notary fees average 1.5-2% of purchase price. Property registry fees (0.5-1%) and surveyor costs (€300-500) complete legal documentation requirements. Mortgage arrangement fees (1-2%) apply if securing financing. Real estate agent commissions (typically 3%) are often negotiable or vendor-paid. Complete cost transparency requires itemized quotes from legal counsel prior to purchase commitment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Costa Blanca a good place to buy property for investment?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca represents one of Europe's most established property investment markets with mature rental infrastructure, proven tourism demand, and consistent 6-8% annual appreciation. However, market saturation requires positioning properties through unique value propositions—authentic locations like Aguilas outperform oversaturated coastal resorts. Currency diversification, inflation hedging, and rental income in euros provide portfolio benefits for international investors. Due diligence regarding local regulations, rental restrictions, and community fees remains essential for informed investment decisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Combien coûtent les taxes foncières en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Les taxes foncières annuelles (IBI - Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles) average 0.4-1.1% of cadastral property value annually. Non-resident property taxes add approximately 1% annually on declared property value. Capital gains tax applies to resale profits: 19% for EU residents, 24% for non-residents (though Spain-UK tax treaty provides modifications). Rental income taxes require professional accounting: non-residents face 24% withholding on net rental income. Comprehensive tax planning through Spanish accountants and international tax counsel optimizes fiscal efficiency for foreign investors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Ai-je besoin d'un visa pour acheter un bien en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically to purchase Spanish property. However, extended stays beyond 90-day tourist allowances require residency permits (Visa de Residencia) demonstrating financial resources (typically €27,792 annually) or EU membership. Non-EU investors without Spanish employment may require passive income documentation from investments, pensions, or savings. Digital Nomad Visas (1-year renewable) support remote workers with €2,300 monthly income documentation. Residency and visa requirements depend on nationality and intended stay duration rather than property ownership itself."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is this apartment in Aguilas a better investment than larger properties?",
      "answer": "This 71m² apartment maximizes rental yield per square meter through efficient design serving high-demand tourist demographics (couples, small families). Smaller properties typically achieve higher occupancy rates (85-90%) versus larger units, shorter turnover periods between guests, and reduced maintenance costs as percentage of rental income. Lower acquisition price enables portfolio diversification across multiple properties. Management complexity remains minimal while rental platform visibility typically rewards 2-bedroom properties through premium search placement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the cost of living in Aguilas for rental guests?",
      "answer": "Daily visitor expenditure in Aguilas averages €60-100 excluding accommodation, supporting mid-range tourist demographics. Meals at local restaurants range €12-20 per person, while beachfront dining costs €20-35. Activities including boat rentals, diving, guided tours typically cost €30-80 per person daily. This affordable cost-of-living profile attracts families and retirees to holiday lettings, supporting high repeat-booking rates and positive online reviews essential for rental platform success."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is this property positioned for capital appreciation?",
      "answer": "Aguilas' 8% year-on-year market appreciation—driven by improved infrastructure, growing international recognition, and limited new development—positions this property for medium-term capital gains. The 40% pricing advantage versus island markets suggests significant upside potential as investor awareness increases. Regional infrastructure investments including airport improvements, coastal road upgrades, and tourism promotion support appreciation momentum. 5-10 year holding periods typically realize 50-80% capital gains while maintaining consistent rental income, creating attractive total-return investment profiles for international investors."
