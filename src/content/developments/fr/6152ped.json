  "areaSection": "Pedreguer is a characterful municipality in the Marina Alta district of Alicante province, positioned strategically between the Mediterranean coast and the dramatic inland mountain ranges that define this region's distinctive topography. The area experiences a Mediterranean climate with more than 300 days of annual sunshine, mild winters averaging 12-15°C, and warm summers tempered by coastal breezes. Unlike the overdeveloped coastal stretches further south, Pedreguer maintains a more authentic Spanish character while benefiting from proximity to modern infrastructure and international amenities. The municipality has evolved into a preferred location for discerning expatriates seeking genuine Spanish lifestyle rather than resort-based living, with established communities of British, German, and Scandinavian residents who have created a sophisticated, international environment. The surrounding landscape features olive groves, almond orchards, and pine forests that provide both aesthetic appeal and a sense of genuine Mediterranean authenticity.",
