This 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom villa offers the space to grow your family deserves, set on a 209m² plot with 133m² of thoughtfully designed living space.

Whether you're relocating for work, seeking a Mediterranean base for your children's education, or planning a lifestyle change, this villa provides the foundation for genuine family memories. The combination of affordable pricing, strategic location within 20 minutes of Blue Flag beaches, and established infrastructure makes Dolores an increasingly smart choice for UK and European families looking beyond the overcrowded coastal hotspots.",
  "areaSection": "Dolores is a traditional Costa Blanca town located in the inland region of Alicante Province, approximately 25 kilometers from the Mediterranean coast. This strategic position offers families the best of both worlds: authentic village character with easy access to beaches and modern amenities. The town benefits from a genuine Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually, warm but not oppressive summers, and mild winters ideal for families seeking year-round outdoor activities. The surrounding landscape features orange groves and agricultural heritage that define the region's identity, yet Dolores itself has modernized thoughtfully with good infrastructure. The established expat community means excellent local support networks, reliable English-speaking services, and family-oriented businesses. As property prices have risen 8% year-on-year in this area, early movers recognize the value—the market is appreciating but hasn't yet reached the saturation and premium pricing of beachfront developments.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Dolores combines the relaxed pace of a Spanish village with genuine family functionality. The local market culture thrives weekly with fresh produce vendors, and major supermarkets including Mercadona, Lidl, and Consum provide familiar shopping convenience. The established international community means you'll find English-speaking doctors, family-friendly restaurants accommodating dietary preferences, and social networks where your children will quickly find peer groups. Weekend life revolves around nearby attractions: Blue Flag beaches for summer days, championship golf courses for parents seeking relaxation, and regional cultural events that feel authentically Spanish yet welcoming to newcomers. Healthcare access is excellent with English-speaking doctors at private clinics and a regional hospital within 30 minutes. The town itself maintains a safe, family-oriented atmosphere with local schools and the surrounding area providing countryside exploration opportunities for active families. Public buses connect to larger towns, though families typically find a car essential for the flexibility coastal Spanish life offers.",
  "investmentSection": "This property represents genuine investment merit for families considering both lifestyle and financial returns. Dolores has experienced consistent 8% year-on-year property appreciation, outpacing inflation while remaining below the saturation pricing of coastal developments. At €3,301/m², this villa trades at a significant premium to Dolores' €2,200/m² average—reflecting its superior condition and specifications—yet remains 40% cheaper than comparable properties on Mallorca, Ibiza, or other island markets. The €800+ weekly rental income during peak season (26 weeks annually) generates approximately €20,000 annual gross rental return, attractive for families considering part-time holiday letting during periods when you're not using the property. Dolores' growing appeal to international families and remote workers suggests continued appreciation potential. Unlike purely speculative investments, you're purchasing a genuine family home with tangible lifestyle benefits and proven rental demand from the established tourism infrastructure supporting the region.",
  "conclusion": "This 3-bedroom villa in Dolores represents a genuine opportunity for families seeking Mediterranean lifestyle combined with financial sensibility. At €439,000 with premium specifications—40% less expensive than island market equivalents—you're acquiring a family home with authentic appreciation potential in a growing region. The combination of safe neighborhoods, proximity to schools and beaches, established expat support networks, and affordable living makes Dolores increasingly attractive for UK and European family relocations. Rather than overpaying for saturated coastal developments, you're investing in a community where international families have created genuine networks and support systems. Whether considering this as a primary residence, holiday base, or investment property with rental income, the fundamentals are sound. The 8% year-on-year appreciation suggests the current pricing window is attractive before the market catches up to its true value.

    {
      "question": "La Costa Blanca est-elle un bon endroit pour acheter un bien immobilier ?",
      "answer": "Yes. Costa Blanca offers consistent property appreciation (8% year-on-year in this area), excellent beaches, established infrastructure, and a thriving international community. Unlike overcrowded coastal developments, inland towns like Dolores provide authentic lifestyle combined with modern conveniences. The region suits families, retirees, and investors seeking Mediterranean living with proven financial performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Yes. Non-EU and EU citizens can purchase property in Spain with straightforward procedures. You'll need an NIE (Spanish tax identification number) and typically work with Spanish legal advisors for property transactions. English-speaking lawyers specializing in property sales are readily available throughout Costa Blanca. The process is transparent and well-established for international buyers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quels sont les frais d'achat d'un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect additional costs of approximately 8-10%: property transfer tax (3-8% depending on region), notary fees (0.5-1%), land registry costs, and legal fees (1-2%). Dolores properties typically have lower transfer taxes than coastal developments. Your legal advisor provides exact breakdown before proceeding. These costs are comparable to or lower than UK property acquisition."
    },
    {
      "question": "Puis-je obtenir un prêt hypothécaire en Espagne en tant qu'étranger ?",
      "answer": "Yes. Spanish banks routinely offer mortgages to non-Spanish residents, typically 70-80% LTV (loan-to-value) at competitive rates. UK nationals benefit from established lending relationships and straightforward documentation. Interest rates are often more favorable than UK mortgages. Working with Spanish mortgage brokers who serve international clients streamlines the process considerably."

Healthcare costs are lower than private UK options. Property maintenance and household help are very affordable. While international schools represent higher costs, overall family budgets extend considerably further than equivalent UK spending."
    },

      "question": "Quel temps fait-il sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Over 300 days of sunshine annually with warm summers (28-32°C) and mild winters (10-15°C). Coastal areas enjoy sea breezes, while inland Dolores provides slightly cooler summer temperatures. Rainfall is minimal, concentrated in autumn and spring. The climate is ideal for outdoor family activities year-round, reducing seasonal weather constraints compared to Northern Europe."
    },
    {
      "question": "How close is this property to beaches and schools?",
      "answer": "This Dolores villa sits within 20 minutes driving to multiple Blue Flag beaches providing safe family swimming and water activities. International British curriculum schools are located 8-15 kilometers throughout the region, while local Spanish schools with English programs serve the immediate area. The balance of beach access and school proximity makes it ideal for active families."
    },
    {
      "question": "What rental income can this property generate?",
      "answer": "Similar properties in Dolores generate €800+ weekly during peak season (May-September), approximately €20,000-25,000 annually across 26+ weeks.
