  "heroIntro": "Welcome to reference N9420, an exceptionally positioned penthouse apartment in Torrevieja's most sought-after beachfront development. Situated just 250 meters from the pristine sands of Playa de El Cura, this modern one-bedroom residence represents an ideal opportunity for both holiday seekers and savvy property investors looking to capitalize on Costa Blanca's booming tourism sector.\n\nThis newly constructed property is part of a thoughtfully designed 17-unit complex that combines contemporary architecture with practical, comfortable living spaces. At 64 square meters, the apartment maximizes functionality without unnecessary square footage, making it perfect for singles, couples, or those seeking a low-maintenance Mediterranean retreat. The penthouse designation suggests elevated positioning within the building, likely offering enhanced privacy and natural light.\n\nTorrevieja has transformed from a traditional fishing village into one of Spain's most dynamic coastal communities. El Cura Beach, your doorstep, attracts thousands of visitors annually with its golden sands, clear Mediterranean waters, and vibrant beach culture. This proximity fundamentally changes your property's appeal—whether for personal enjoyment or generating consistent rental income during peak season.",
  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's rental market has demonstrated exceptional resilience and growth. With over 4 million visitors annually to Costa Blanca and the town's reputation as a premier beach destination, short-term holiday rentals command strong rates. A one-bedroom penthouse in this location typically generates €600-€900 monthly during off-season and €1,200-€1,800 during summer months. The modest size and modern amenities appeal directly to couples and solo travelers, who often spend more per night than families in larger apartments.\n\nBeyond rental potential, property values in beachfront Torrevieja have appreciated steadily. The combination of EU citizenship accessibility, Spanish residence permits, and the town's established expat community creates consistent demand. This development's newness and comprehensive design position it competitively against aging stock, making it particularly attractive to buyers seeking turnkey investment with minimal renovation costs.",
