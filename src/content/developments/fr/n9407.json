  "areaSection": "Fuente Álamo sits in the heart of Murcia's southern coast, positioned strategically between the bustling beaches of the Costa Blanca and the inland agricultural heartland. This positioning offers the best of both worlds—authentic Spanish living without sacrificing access to international amenities. The climate is Mediterranean with hot, dry summers and mild winters, making it habitable year-round. The town itself maintains a genuine Spanish character with growing infrastructure improvements reflecting regional development. Located approximately 50km from Alicante International Airport and 30km from the coast, Fuente Álamo offers accessibility without the congestion of coastal tourist zones. The surrounding Hacienda Del Álamo Golf community represents one of the region's most established residential developments, attracting families and retirees seeking stability and community.",

The regional market shows consistent +8% year-on-year appreciation, suggesting solid long-term value growth.
