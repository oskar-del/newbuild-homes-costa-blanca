    {
      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Yes. Non-EU citizens and EU citizens have essentially identical property purchase rights in Spain. Foreigner ownership is protected constitutionally, requiring only an NIE (tax identification number) obtainable through the Spanish tax authority. No restrictions limit property value, location, or quantity of purchases. Legal protections equivalent to Spanish citizens apply. Specialist international property attorneys typically manage purchase transactions, ensuring compliance with Spanish conveyancing procedures and your jurisdictional requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quels sont les frais d'achat d'un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Purchase costs beyond the property price typically total 8-10% of the acquisition value. These include: transfer tax (6-10% depending on autonomous community), notary fees (€800-€1,500), property registry costs (€500-€1,000), and legal representation (€1,500-€3,000). Mortgage arrangement fees apply if financing. Post-purchase annual costs include property tax (0.4-1.1% of cadastral value), municipality fees, and optional private insurance. These costs remain substantially below equivalent UK property transactions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Combien coûtent les taxes foncières en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Annual property tax (IBI) averages 0.4-1.1% of the cadastral value (typically 50-70% of market value). For this €725,000 property, estimated annual IBI would be €1,200-€2,000. Additionally, residents pay municipal fees (basura tax, typically €150-€300 annually) and optional private insurance.

Overall annual holding costs remain modest compared to Northern European equivalents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Puis-je obtenir un prêt hypothécaire en Espagne en tant qu'étranger ?",

Interest rates for foreigners typically range 3.5-4.5% depending on credit profile and loan-to-value ratio. Documentation requirements include passport, income verification, and employment history. Specialist mortgage brokers familiar with non-resident requirements significantly simplify the process. Many foreigners secure financing through their home country banks, which sometimes offer competitive rates for offshore properties."

    },
    {
      "question": "La Costa Blanca est-elle adaptée aux retraités ?",
      "answer": "Excellent. Costa Blanca attracts significant retiree populations due to favorable climate, affordable healthcare, low cost of living, and established English-speaking expatriate communities. Spanish residency via Non-Lucrative Visa requires minimal income (€1,260 monthly) and provides permanent residence rights. Healthcare quality exceeds many home countries at fraction of the cost. The social infrastructure, including clubs, activities, and volunteer opportunities, creates comprehensive community engagement. Property purchases offer retirees lifestyle enhancement with capital preservation or appreciation potential."
