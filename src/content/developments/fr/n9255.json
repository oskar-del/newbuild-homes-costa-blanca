  "areaSection": "La Manga del Mar Menor is a distinctive coastal gem located in Murcia's southeastern region, famous for its unique geography. The area sits on a natural sandbar that separates the Mediterranean Sea from the Mar Menor lagoon, creating a dual-water environment that's unparalleled in Europe. This creates exceptional conditions year-round: calm lagoon waters ideal for swimming and water sports, while the Mediterranean offers traditional beach experiences. The climate is Mediterranean with over 300 days of sunshine annually, mild winters (rarely below 10°C), and warm summers perfectly suited to outdoor living. The lagoon itself, a UNESCO-protected natural park, provides a calmer alternative to open-sea beaches while maintaining pristine water quality. The entire area benefits from both modern tourist infrastructure and authentic Spanish charm, making it equally appealing for holiday escapes and permanent relocation.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in La Manga del Mar Menor means embracing a relaxed Mediterranean rhythm where beach culture and international community coexist seamlessly. The established expat population—particularly British, German, and Scandinavian residents—has created an inclusive environment where English is widely spoken and familiar amenities are readily available. Daily life revolves around outdoor activities: beach clubs dot the shoreline, local chiringuitos serve fresh seafood while you watch sunsets, and the lagoon offers kayaking, paddleboarding, and sailing. The community is vibrant but unhurried, with weekly markets showcasing fresh local produce, supermarkets meeting international dietary requirements, and restaurants ranging from casual beach shacks to fine dining. Healthcare is excellent with regional hospitals and private clinics staffed by English-speaking doctors. Families appreciate the international schools offering British and European curricula. This isn't isolated tourism—it's a functioning, well-serviced community where holiday homes sit alongside permanent residences, creating a genuinely welcoming atmosphere.",

The region combines year-round sunshine (300+ days annually), established infrastructure, international amenities, and strong holiday rental demand—making it ideal for both lifestyle buyers and investors seeking reliable returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Foreign nationals (EU and non-EU citizens) enjoy equal property ownership rights in Spain with no restrictions on residential or investment purchases. The process is transparent and well-established, with English-speaking lawyers and notaries available throughout the process. Most British and international buyers complete purchases with minimal complications using proper legal representation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quels sont les frais d'achat d'un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Quel temps fait-il sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca experiences exceptional Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of annual sunshine. Summer temperatures average 28-32°C (comfortable with sea breezes), winters average 10-15°C (mild, rarely freezing), and spring/autumn provide perfect outdoor weather. La Manga's unique dual-water position creates additional cooling breezes, making summer temperatures feel less extreme than inland regions."
    },

      "answer": "Absolutely. La Manga del Mar Menor is specifically designed for holiday living with year-round beach access, over 300 days of sunshine, and established tourist infrastructure. The dual-water advantage (Mediterranean Sea and calm Mar Menor lagoon) provides options for different moods. Proven rental demand (€800+/week during peak season) makes holiday home ownership a viable investment, not merely a lifestyle choice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quels revenus locatifs puis-je attendre de ce bien ?",
      "answer": "Holiday rental market data shows comparable 2-bedroom properties in La Manga del Mar Menor commanding €800+/week during peak season (July-August) and €500-600 during shoulder months (May-June, September-October). Conservative estimates suggest €20,000-25,000 annual rental income for selective owners renting 30-35 weeks yearly.
