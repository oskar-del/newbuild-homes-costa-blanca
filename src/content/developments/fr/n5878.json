  "metaTitle": "3 Chambres Apartment €341k Aguilas - Investment Property",
  "metaDescription": "€341,000 3-bedroom apartment Aguilas. Premium spec, 40% below island markets. Strong rental yield potential. 39 images, move-in ready.",
  "heroIntro": "This 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Isla Del Fraile, Aguilas represents a compelling investment opportunity in one of Murcia's most undervalued coastal locations. Priced at €341,000 (€4,210/m²), this property sits 40% below comparable Spanish island markets while offering genuine capital appreciation potential. The Costa Blanca region is experiencing consistent +8% year-on-year growth, and Aguilas specifically is emerging as savvy investors' alternative to oversaturated coastal markets. With typical holiday let rentals commanding €800 per week, this apartment generates strong seasonal income while maintaining long-term appreciation prospects. The 81m² built area maximizes efficiency without the premium pricing of nearby tourist hotspots. This is strategic investment intelligence: buy where others haven't fully discovered yet, before price alignment occurs inevitably with comparable Mediterranean assets.",
  "areaSection": "Aguilas is a working coastal town in southeastern Murcia, positioned strategically between mass-market tourism zones and authentic Spanish living. Located on the Mediterranean coast with direct beach access, the town maintains year-round mild climate (average 17°C winter, 28°C summer) with 320+ days of sunshine annually. The geography offers protected coves, dramatic rocky coastline, and multiple Blue Flag beaches within walking distance. Unlike crowded Costa Blanca hotspots, Aguilas retains genuine character—traditional fishing heritage blends with modern amenities. The town has undergone selective modernization without losing authenticity. Infrastructure is solid: regional hospital, modern supermarkets, and reliable transport connections. Property prices here still reflect authentic value before inevitable tourist-driven appreciation.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Aguilas revolves around Mediterranean rhythms with practical convenience. The established international community speaks English widely, eliminating language barriers for British and Northern European residents. Beach culture is genuine—multiple Blue Flag beaches offer water sports, coastal walks, and summer social activity. The local food scene balances fresh seafood restaurants with international options catering to the expat demographic. Weekly markets provide fresh produce at authentic prices. Healthcare access includes regional hospitals and private English-speaking clinics within 30 minutes. Supermarkets (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum) stock familiar products. For investors considering rental management, the expat infrastructure means professional property management companies understand international guest expectations. Golf courses nearby serve the sporting demographic. The pace is deliberately slower than Benidorm or Torrevieja—ideal for investors seeking long-term stability over speculative gambling.",
  "investmentSection": "The investment thesis is clear: Aguilas trades at €4,210/m² versus Spanish island averages of €7,000+/m². Regional market growth of +8% year-on-year means this €341,000 acquisition appreciates approximately €27,000 annually in baseline appreciation. Holiday let rental potential generates €800 weekly (€3,200 monthly in peak season, €1,600 shoulder season). Annual gross rental income realistically reaches €35,000-40,000 with professional management, producing 10-12% gross yield on purchase price. Unlike buy-to-let saturated UK markets, Spanish property tax treatment favors investors, and the Murcia region actively encourages foreign investment. Aguilas specifically benefits from infrastructure investment and emerging recognition among UK/Scandinavian investors—demand curve is accelerating. First-mover advantage remains available; prices will harmonize with comparable coastal properties within 5-7 years.",
  "conclusion": "This Aguilas apartment represents disciplined investment opportunity: premium specification at genuine value pricing, established rental demand, and positioned strategically on appreciation curve as Murcia's emerging market recognition accelerates. €341,000 captures optimal entry point before price harmonization with comparable Mediterranean assets occurs inevitably. Movement-ready furnished condition eliminates delay between purchase and income generation. The investment case resolves simply—capital appreciation potential combined with 10-12% rental yield generates dual return pathway. Northern European investors increasingly recognize Aguilas advantage over saturated Costa Blanca hotspots. Contact via WhatsApp for professional property consultation, mortgage guidance, and tax-efficient acquisition planning. Genuine opportunities in emerging Mediterranean markets require decisive action—this property will not remain available at current valuation.",

    },

This move-in ready approach eliminates delay and capital outlay—investor preference for turnkey rental assets."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel temps fait-il sur la Costa Blanca ?",
