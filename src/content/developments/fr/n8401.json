    },
    {
      "question": "La Costa Blanca est-elle adaptée aux retraités ?",

    },
    {

    {
      "question": "Why is this property 40% cheaper than Spanish islands?",
      "answer": "Los Alcazares remains undervalued compared to Ibiza and Mallorca despite offering superior value and authentic Spanish living. Island properties command premium pricing due to international fame and perceived scarcity. Los Alcazares offers identical weather, beaches, and community with significantly lower acquisition costs. As the town becomes increasingly recognized, prices are rising 8% annually—offering genuine appreciation potential at entry-level pricing compared to established destinations."
