  "areaSection": "Finestrat is a municipality on the Costa Blanca in Alicante province, positioned between the popular destinations of Benidorm and Altea. The town sits at the foot of Puig Campana, a distinctive 1,100-meter mountain that defines the landscape and provides stunning vistas. Finestrat enjoys a Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually, mild winters averaging 12-15°C, and warm summers around 28-30°C. The location offers the perfect balance: close enough to major infrastructure and amenities, yet removed from the overcrowding of neighboring resort towns. The town has undergone significant development with quality residential projects, attracting both permanent residents and investors. Its proximity to Alicante airport (45 minutes) and the N-332 coastal road makes it highly accessible. The combination of natural beauty, modern infrastructure, and relatively affordable pricing compared to neighboring areas has established Finestrat as an increasingly attractive investment destination for international property buyers.",

      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners can purchase property in Spain without restrictions. Most foreign buyers require a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and must complete standard conveyancing procedures.

EU/UK citizens benefit from visa-free travel agreements. However, non-EU residents may eventually require residence permits if planning extended stays (typically 90+ days). Property ownership facilitates residency applications but doesn't automatically grant permission. Consult Spanish consulate for your nationality's specific requirements."

At realistic 60% occupancy rates (conservative for coastal locations), annual rental income reaches €23,400-€26,400.

    },
    {
      "question": "Quel temps fait-il sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually. Winters are mild (12-15°C average) with minimal rainfall.
