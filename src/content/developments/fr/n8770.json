    },
    {
      "question": "What taxes will I pay on rental income from this property?",
      "answer": "Rental income is taxed at progressive rates (19-45%) through Spanish non-resident income tax. You can deduct expenses including mortgage interest, maintenance, cleaning, insurance, and platform fees, significantly reducing taxable income. Net yield after tax typically reaches 12-15%. Property tax (IBI) averages €150-200 annually. Many investors employ Spanish tax accountants (€300-500 annually) to optimize deductions and ensure compliance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is this property cheaper than coastal alternatives?",
      "answer": "This property is priced at €3,125/m² versus coastal averages of €5,000-8,000/m² because it's located 20 minutes inland rather than beachfront. This inland positioning paradoxically creates investment value: lower acquisition costs, lower carrying costs, but similar rental income due to established tourism infrastructure. Beachfront premiums reflect lifestyle factors rather than rental yield, making inland properties like this superior for purely investment-focused buyers."
