    },
    {
      "question": "La Costa Blanca est-elle un bon endroit pour acheter un bien immobilier ?",

Costa Blanca consistently ranks among Europe's best property investment regions, with steady price growth (8% year-on-year in Baños y Mendigo), established expatriate communities, reliable rental income potential, and straightforward legal frameworks for international buyers.

    },
    {
      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Non-EU and EU citizens have equal property purchase rights in Spain. No residency requirement exists for property ownership. The process is straightforward: obtain a NIE tax number, hire a lawyer (essential), conduct property surveys, and sign before a notary. Most sales complete within 6-8 weeks. UK citizens post-Brexit maintain identical purchase rights as before."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quels sont les frais d'achat d'un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Beyond the property price, expect: notary fees (0.5-1% of purchase price), property registry fees (0.1%), legal fees (€1,000-€3,000), and IVA/property tax (3-5% depending on property type). For purchases over €600,000, Plusvalía local tax applies. Total acquisition costs typically total 6-8% beyond the advertised price. These are substantially lower than UK conveyancing costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel est le coût de la vie sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Significantly lower than the UK. Groceries cost approximately 25-30% less, utilities 20-25% less, and dining out 30-40% less. International school fees are 40-50% below equivalent UK independent schools. Healthcare through the Spanish system is inexpensive or free. Overall, a family spending £3,000/month in the UK typically maintains the same lifestyle on €2,000-€2,500 on Costa Blanca, depending on chosen amenities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Combien coûtent les taxes foncières en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Les taxes foncières annuelles (Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles) in Murcia average €300-€600 annually depending on property value and municipal rates. This is minimal compared to UK council tax. Wealth tax applies only to properties exceeding €600,000. Capital gains tax applies on future sale (19-45% depending on ownership period). Spanish mortgage interest remains tax-deductible in some circumstances. Consult with a Spanish tax advisor for your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Puis-je obtenir un prêt hypothécaire en Espagne en tant qu'étranger ?",
      "answer": "Yes. Major Spanish banks (BBVA, Santander, CaixaBank) routinely offer mortgages to non-resident foreigners, typically 70-80% loan-to-value ratios with interest rates currently 3-4%. UK citizens find the process straightforward, requiring proof of income, employment verification, and credit history. Mortgages are denominated in euros, protecting against currency fluctuation. Many expats prefer mortgages to manage liquidity while retaining investment leverage."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel temps fait-il sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Exceptional year-round. Expect 300+ sunny days annually with average temperatures of 28°C in summer and 15°C in winter—freezing weather is extremely rare. The Mediterranean climate means winter months remain pleasant for outdoor activities. April through October is reliably warm and dry. November through March brings occasional rainfall but remains significantly sunnier than the UK. Most families find the climate perfect for outdoor family activities throughout the year."
    },
    {
      "question": "What schools are available near this property?",
      "answer": "Several international schools offering British curriculum education operate within 8-15 minutes of Altaona Golf properties. These schools serve established expat communities and maintain excellent academic standards at fees substantially lower than equivalent UK independent schools. Spanish state schools are also highly regarded and increasingly popular with bilingual families. Most schools provide after-school activities, sports programs, and transportation options."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this property suitable for holiday rentals?",
      "answer": "Yes, excellent potential. Similar 3-bedroom properties in the region typically generate €800 per week through platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo during peak season (June-September). Shoulder seasons (April-May, October) yield €500-€600 weekly. Winter months remain profitable at €400-€500 weekly due to golf tourism and European winter escapes. Management agencies handle bookings and maintenance, typically charging 20-30% commission. Many owner-occupiers use short-term rentals to offset mortgage and maintenance costs."
