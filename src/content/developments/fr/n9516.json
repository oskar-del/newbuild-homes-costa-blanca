      "answer": "€385,000. This 3-bedroom villa represents exceptional value at €3,031/m² compared to Spanish island markets (40% cheaper). The property is priced above Pinoso's €2,200/m² average due to premium specification, spacious plot, and family-friendly location. Payment options typically include cash, mortgage financing (available for foreign buyers), or installment arrangements with the seller."
    },
    {
      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Non-EU and EU citizens can freely purchase Spanish property—no special visa required solely for property purchase. Legal requirements include a Spanish tax number (NIE), local notary involvement, and standard conveyancing. British, Scandinavian, and other international nationals routinely purchase in Costa Blanca. Professional legal advisors specializing in international clients manage the straightforward process. Most purchases complete within 4-8 weeks from offer to completion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quels sont les frais d'achat d'un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Total acquisition costs typically range 6-10% of the property price. This includes: property transfer tax (6-8%, varies by region), notary fees (0.5-1%), land registry fees (0.1%), and legal advisor costs (0.5-1%). For this €385,000 property, budget approximately €23,000-€38,500 in additional costs. Some costs are negotiable. No stamp duty like UK exists. Subsequent annual property tax runs 0.4-1.1% of cadastral value (typically lower than actual sale price)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Puis-je obtenir un prêt hypothécaire en Espagne en tant qu'étranger ?",
      "answer": "Yes, many Spanish banks lend to foreign buyers, typically offering 70-80% loan-to-value financing. British nationals commonly secure mortgages at competitive rates (currently 3-4%). Lenders require proof of income, credit history, and identification documents. Non-resident accounts may face slightly stricter criteria than residents. Most international buyers in Costa Blanca successfully obtain financing. Professional mortgage brokers specializing in foreign buyers simplify the process significantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "La Costa Blanca est-elle un bon endroit pour acheter un bien immobilier ?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is excellent for family property investment, particularly inland areas like Pinoso. The region combines established international communities, modern healthcare and education facilities, with authentic Spanish village living. Markets show 8% year-on-year appreciation in areas like Pinoso. Rental demand from holiday and long-term tenants remains strong (€800+ weekly). Unlike saturated coastal areas, inland properties offer genuine growth potential as families increasingly seek lifestyle balance over beach proximity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel est le coût de la vie sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Cost of living is dramatically lower than UK, northern Europe, or Scandinavia. Families typically spend 30-50% less than equivalent UK budgets. Childcare costs €200-350/month versus £600-1200 in UK. International school fees (€3,000-6,000 annually) compare favorably to private schools elsewhere. Groceries, fuel, and utilities cost significantly less. Healthcare (if private) runs €50-100 per appointment, much cheaper than private UK costs. Housing costs in Pinoso are particularly reasonable—your mortgage payment likely rivals UK rental costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel temps fait-il sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys Mediterranean climate with 300+ sunshine days annually. Summers (June-September) are warm and dry, reaching 28-32°C (82-90°F) with minimal rainfall. Winters are mild, averaging 10-15°C (50-59°F)—frost and snow extremely rare. Spring and autumn are perfect, offering 18-25°C (64-77°F) with pleasant sunshine. Humidity is lower than coastal areas due to inland location. The climate supports outdoor family activities year-round—beach visits possible even in January. Air conditioning and ceiling fans handle summer heat; central heating less necessary than UK homes."
    },
    {
      "question": "À quelle distance se trouve la Costa Blanca de la France ?",
      "answer": "Alicante Airport is 2.5-3 hours flight time from UK major airports (London, Manchester, Birmingham). Direct flights operate multiple times daily with budget carriers and full-service airlines. Ferry routes via France add 24-48 hours. Distance creates practical separation while maintaining accessibility—visiting family for two weeks costs €100-200 return flights. Many UK families visit quarterly. The journey is straightforward enough that grandparents regularly visit, while still encouraging independence in your new location."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why choose Pinoso over coastal Costa Blanca areas?",
      "answer": "Pinoso offers several advantages over saturated coastal regions. Property prices are 30-50% lower than beachfront while quality remains high—you get more space for your budget. The village maintains authentic Spanish character without tourist crowds. Schools and healthcare are excellent, attracting quality expat families rather than transient tourists. Rental income potential (€800+ weekly) rivals coastal properties with lower competition. The established English-speaking community provides natural integration. Appreciation potential is significantly higher as market matures—early adopters benefit before mass-market development. Lifestyle balance is superior—beaches are only 20 minutes away when desired, but daily life isn't tourist-dependent."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the rental potential for this property?",
      "answer": "This villa has strong rental income potential estimated at €800+ per week (€35,000+ annually) through professional vacation rental management. The 3-bedroom, 10,700m² plot appeals to families, multigenerational groups, and extended parties willing to pay premium rates. Pinoso's emerging popularity as a family destination supports consistent booking demand. Off-season rates (May-June, September-October) remain solid. Many owners combine part-time rental with personal use—occupying 6-8 weeks annually while earning €25,000-30,000 from remaining weeks. Professional property managers handle all bookings, cleaning, and guest communication for 25-30% commission."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this property suitable for a large family?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. The 3 bedrooms accommodate 6-8 people comfortably, while the 10,700m² plot provides exceptional outdoor space for children's play, sports, and activities. Two bathrooms are adequate for families with coordinated routines. The open-plan living areas allow parents to supervise children while cooking or working. The plot size allows for future expansion—adding a fourth bedroom or guest annex if needed. Countryside location provides safety children can't find in apartments or densely developed suburbs. The space genuinely allows for growing children through teenage years without feeling cramped. Many multigenerational families successfully use properties of this size with visiting grandparents in summer."
