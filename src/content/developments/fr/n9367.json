  "metaTitle": "3 Chambres Town House Finestrat €450,000 | Costa Blanca",
  "metaDescription": "Magnifique 3-bedroom town house in Finestrat, Costa Blanca. €450,000. Premium build, 176m², perfect holiday home. 40% less than island markets.",
  "heroIntro": "Imagine waking up to Mediterranean sunshine, stepping onto your own private terrace, knowing that world-class beaches, championship golf courses, and charming Spanish villages are all within minutes of your door. This exceptional 3-bedroom town house in Balcón De Finestrat offers exactly that—a holiday home that doesn't feel like a compromise. At €450,000, you're acquiring a premium specification property at 40% less than comparable properties in Spanish island markets, making this one of the shrewdest investments on the Costa Blanca right now.\n\nFinestrat has quietly become the preferred choice for discerning buyers seeking authentic Mediterranean living without the overcrowding of more commercialised coastal towns. This town house represents the sweet spot: modern comforts, established community infrastructure, and genuine value for money. Whether you're envisioning long summer breaks with family, a sophisticated retreat for entertaining friends, or a sound investment generating consistent rental income, this property ticks every box.\n\nWith 176m² of thoughtfully designed living space across three bedrooms and two bathrooms, plus an additional 42m² plot, this is a property built for the way people actually want to live on the Costa Blanca—comfortable, connected, and authentically Mediterranean.",
  "areaSection": "Finestrat sits on the northern edge of the Costa Blanca, perched between the dramatic Sierra Helada mountains and the Mediterranean Sea. This geographic positioning gives it a unique character—close enough to major towns like Benidorm for amenities, yet far enough removed to feel genuinely peaceful. The landscape here is dramatic: pine-covered hills rolling down to hidden coves and sandy beaches. The climate is reliably sunny year-round, with over 300 days of sunshine annually and temperatures ranging from comfortable 15°C in winter to perfect 28-30°C in summer. Unlike the overdeveloped coastal strips elsewhere, Finestrat has maintained its charm through thoughtful development. The town itself retains Spanish authenticity—you'll find genuine family-run restaurants, a proper weekly market, and locals who've lived here for generations alongside newer residents. The infrastructure is modern without being intrusive, and the expat community has integrated seamlessly, meaning English is widely spoken but Spanish culture remains genuinely alive.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Finestrat revolves around a rhythm that visitors often envy. Start your morning with coffee at a local café overlooking the sea, pop down to the beach for a swim, then perhaps lunch at one of the seafront chiringuitos serving fresh fish and paella. The established international community—particularly strong British, German, and Scandinavian populations—means you'll find English speakers everywhere, from restaurants to medical clinics, yet the town never feels like an expat bubble. Healthcare is excellent: the regional hospital is within 30 minutes, and private clinics with English-speaking doctors are readily available. Shopping is straightforward with Mercadona, Lidl, and local markets covering all needs. Weekends might involve a round of golf at one of several championship courses nearby, dinner at a Michelin-recommended restaurant in neighbouring Altea, or simply relaxing by the pools and beaches. The international school options mean families aren't compromising on education. For those who value both stimulation and tranquility, Finestrat delivers both—it's close enough to excitement but positioned perfectly for a genuine Mediterranean escape.",
  "investmentSection": "Beyond the lifestyle appeal, this property represents compelling investment logic. Finestrat's property market has grown 8% year-on-year, outpacing broader Costa Blanca trends, as buyers increasingly favour authentic towns over overdeveloped hotspots. At €2,557/m², you're paying only 16% above Finestrat's €2,200/m² average—a premium that reflects this specific property's quality, not market overvaluation. The rental potential is substantial: comparable properties in this area consistently achieve €800 per week during peak season, with solid demand year-round from holiday renters. A conservative estimate of 20 weeks annual lets generates €16,000 income. When compared to Spanish island markets where equivalent properties command 40% higher prices, this represents exceptional value for purchase-to-yield investors. Whether you're building a diversified investment portfolio or securing a European base that pays for itself through lettings, the fundamentals are sound. The established community infrastructure and improving regional connectivity suggest continued appreciation.",
  "conclusion": "This 3-bedroom town house represents the convergence of lifestyle appeal and investment logic. You're acquiring a Mediterranean home positioned in an established community, priced substantially below island alternatives, generating consistent rental demand, and positioned in a market appreciating 8% annually. Whether you're seeking a genuine holiday retreat, a sound investment generating €16,000+ annual rental income, or a lifestyle base for Mediterranean living, every metric aligns. The combination of premium specification, rational pricing, established infrastructure, and genuine Mediterranean experience makes Finestrat increasingly the choice of discerning buyers.

    {
      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners can purchase property in Spain with virtually no restrictions.

    },
    {
      "question": "Quels sont les frais d'achat d'un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Quel temps fait-il sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Exceptional. Finestrat enjoys over 300 days of sunshine annually with average temperatures of 15-17°C in winter and 28-30°C in summer. It's warm enough for beach use April through October, with mild, pleasant winters. The Sierra Helada mountains provide protection from northern winds.

    },
    {
      "question": "Quel est le coût de la vie sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Cost of living is substantially lower than Northern Europe. Groceries are approximately 30-40% cheaper than UK prices, dining out ranges from €12-€25 for quality meals, utilities cost roughly €100-€150 monthly, and property maintenance is affordable. Healthcare costs are lower and often covered by private insurance. This means rental income and pensions stretch further—a major appeal for retirees and lifestyle investors."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much rental income could I generate from this property?",
      "answer": "Conservative estimate: €800 per week during peak season (May-September), generating approximately €16,000 annually from 20 weeks' letting. Off-season rates (€400-€600/week) can be achieved during other months with consistent bookings. Comparable properties in Finestrat achieve these figures reliably. This potential rental income means the property can pay for itself while providing your personal holiday use."
    },
    {

      "answer": "Excellent. The established expat community means finding support networks is straightforward, healthcare is first-class with English-speaking doctors, cost of living is lower than Northern Europe stretching pensions further, and the climate supports active outdoor lifestyle year-round. Many UK retirees have relocated to Finestrat specifically, creating natural social communities. Beaches, golf, restaurants, and cultural activities provide genuine lifestyle appeal beyond simple 'cheap retirement'."
    },
    {
      "question": "Puis-je obtenir un prêt hypothécaire en Espagne en tant qu'étranger ?",
      "answer": "Yes. Several banks offer mortgages to foreign buyers, typically up to 70-80% loan-to-value. Interest rates are competitive (currently 3-4%). You'll need proof of income, potentially a Spanish bank account, and professional mortgage advice. Many UK buyers combine Spanish mortgages with retained UK mortgages as part of integrated property strategies. Professional mortgage brokers experienced with foreign buyers can arrange this straightforwardly."
