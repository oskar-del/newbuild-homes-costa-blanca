  "metaTitle": "3-Bed Bungalow €385,000 | Pilar de La Horadada Costa Blanca",
  "metaDescription": "Stylish 3-bedroom bungalow in Torre De La Horadada. €385,000. Perfect holiday home near Blue Flag beaches. Premium build, 40% less than island markets.",
  "heroIntro": "Discover your Mediterranean escape in Torre De La Horadada, a charming corner of Pilar de La Horadada where authentic Spanish coastal living meets modern comfort. This exceptional 3-bedroom bungalow offers the perfect foundation for your holiday home dream—a sunshine retreat where you can wake to endless possibilities of beach days, tapas evenings, and golden sunsets. At €385,000, this premium-specification property delivers remarkable value, priced 40% below comparable Spanish island markets, making it an astute choice for discerning buyers seeking a second home investment. The 78m² thoughtfully designed interior maximizes light and flow, while the 24m² plot provides the intimate outdoor space perfect for morning coffee or twilight relaxation. Located just 20 minutes from some of Costa Blanca's most pristine Blue Flag beaches, this bungalow positions you perfectly between serene coastal moments and the vibrant social fabric of an established international community. Whether you envision long summers hosting family and friends, quiet winter escapes from northern climates, or a rental investment generating €800 weekly returns, this property adapts to your lifestyle. Torre De La Horadada has quietly become a preferred destination for holiday home buyers who value authenticity over overcrowded resorts—where Mediterranean beauty remains unspoiled and genuinely welcoming.",
  "areaSection": "Pilar de La Horadada sits on Spain's southern Costa Blanca coastline, in the province of Alicante, characterised by dramatic limestone cliffs, hidden coves, and crystalline Mediterranean waters. The area enjoys over 300 days of annual sunshine, with mild winters (rarely dropping below 10°C) and warm, sun-soaked summers. This southeastern corner of Spain remains refreshingly underdeveloped compared to neighbouring tourist hotspots—development here has been thoughtful rather than sprawling. The town itself retains genuine Spanish character: narrow streets wind past family-run restaurants, the weekly market brings fresh produce and local colour, and the pace of life encourages lingering conversations over cortados. Located just 40 minutes south of Alicante city and 90 minutes north of Murcia, Pilar de La Horadada occupies a sweet spot between accessibility and seclusion. The surrounding region is dotted with salt lakes, nature reserves, and the dramatic geology that makes this stretch of coast genuinely distinctive. For holiday home buyers, this means proximity to authentic experiences rather than commercialised attractions—you're buying into a place that feels like Spain, not a theme park version of it.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Pilar de La Horadada as a holiday resident means embracing a slower rhythm without sacrificing modern conveniences. The established international community—primarily British, German, and Scandinavian—has created a welcoming ecosystem where English is widely spoken, yet Spanish culture permeates daily life. Your mornings might begin with fresh churros from the local baker, your afternoons at one of multiple Blue Flag beaches within 20 minutes, your evenings at family-run beach chiringuitos serving grilled fish and local wines. The weekly market offers farm-fresh produce, the supermarkets (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum) stock familiar brands alongside Spanish specialties, and healthcare access includes both public facilities and private English-speaking clinics within 30 minutes. Golf enthusiasts will appreciate several championship courses nearby. The expat community hosts social events, language exchanges, and activities without creating the artificial bubble that characterises some resort areas. You're never isolated, yet always able to find peaceful solitude. Internet connectivity supports remote work effortlessly. The car-friendly road network makes exploring the wider Costa Blanca seamless—from nature reserves to mountain villages to larger towns—while the slower pace of Torre De La Horadada itself encourages you to simply be.",
  "investmentSection": "Beyond its lifestyle appeal, this bungalow represents solid investment potential in a market trending upward. Pilar de La Horadada has experienced 8% year-on-year property value growth, outpacing broader Costa Blanca averages. At €4,936/m², this property commands a premium within the local market (where averages sit around €2,200/m²), reflecting its quality construction and strategic location. However, this premium represents exceptional value against Spanish island markets—the same specification would cost significantly more in Mallorca, Menorca, or Ibiza. Rental potential strengthens the investment case: holiday lets in this area typically achieve €800 per week (€3,400 monthly), meaning a property owner could recoup 10-12% annually through seasonal lettings while retaining personal use for premium weeks. The international demographic—affluent Europeans seeking reliable second homes—ensures consistent rental demand. Property taxes in Spain are modest, and recent reforms have made foreign investment increasingly straightforward. With growing interest in alternative Mediterranean destinations and increasing flight connectivity to Alicante, Torre De La Horadada is transitioning from hidden gem to recognised value destination.",
  "conclusion": "This exceptional 3-bedroom bungalow in Torre De La Horadada represents more than a property purchase—it's a gateway to the Mediterranean lifestyle you've imagined. At €385,000 with premium specification and 40% cost advantage over Spanish island markets, it combines lifestyle appeal with investment fundamentals. The established international community, pristine beaches within 20 minutes, year-round sunshine, and strong rental potential create a compelling ownership opportunity. Whether this becomes your cherished summer escape, a year-round retreat, or a reliable income-generating investment, the combination of authenticity, infrastructure, and value is genuinely rare.

    {
      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners have the same property purchase rights as Spanish citizens. Non-residents can buy without residency permits or visas.

    },
    {
      "question": "What are the typical costs of buying property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price (€385,000 here), expect: transfer tax (6-10% depending on region—typically 6% in Alicante), legal fees (€1,000-1,500), notary fees (€400-600), and property registration (€200-400). Total acquisition costs typically total 8-12% of purchase price. Les taxes foncières annuelles are modest (around 0.4-0.7% of property value)."

      "answer": "Yes, Spanish banks readily offer mortgages to foreign buyers. You'll typically need to provide income documentation, proof of funds, and undergo credit checks.

    },
    {
      "question": "Quel est le coût de la vie sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is notably affordable compared to UK and northern Europe. Grocery costs run 20-30% less than UK equivalents, restaurants offer excellent value (€10-15 three-course meals), and utilities are modest.

Coastal breezes moderate summer heat, and rain is minimal (only 35-40 days annually). The Mediterranean microclimate creates ideal conditions for beach living year-round, making this perfect for holiday homes and seasonal living."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this property suitable for holiday lettings?",
      "answer": "Excellent potential. Similar properties in this area achieve €800 weekly rental rates (approximately €3,400 monthly). The 3-bedroom layout appeals to families and small groups. High demand from international tourists, particularly British and European visitors, ensures strong occupancy. Annual returns of 10-12% are realistic with professional management or personal letting during peak seasons."
    },
    {
      "question": "À quelle distance se trouve la Costa Blanca de la France ?",
      "answer": "Alicante International Airport is 55 minutes away with direct flights to London, Manchester, Birmingham, and other UK cities. Flight times are typically 2-2.5 hours from London, and budget airline competition keeps costs reasonable. You can drive (ferries from southern Spain) but flying is the practical standard for holiday home owners."
