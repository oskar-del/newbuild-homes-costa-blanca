  "areaSection": "Finestrat occupies a distinctive position on the Costa Blanca, situated between the renowned resort town of Benidorm and the quieter coastal villages of Altea and Calpe. This elevation-rich municipality benefits from a Mediterranean climate characterized by 320 days of sunshine annually, with temperatures ranging from 15°C in winter to 28°C in summer. The terrain combines rolling hills with strategic proximity to both the coast and interior mountain ranges, creating a varied landscape that appeals to active residents.\n\nThe village itself maintains low-rise development protocols that preserve visual integrity and prevent overdevelopment, distinguishing Finestrat from neighboring tourist-focused municipalities. This planning philosophy has attracted an international demographic seeking substance over spectacle—professionals, entrepreneurs, retirees, and families who value authentic community character alongside modern conveniences. The established infrastructure supports both permanent residents and seasonal visitors, with utilities, connectivity, and services operating to Northern European standards.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Finestrat means embracing a rhythm that balances Mediterranean leisure with practical accessibility. The established expatriate community—predominantly British, Scandinavian, and Central European—has created a sophisticated social fabric where English is widely spoken and cultural institutions cater to international tastes. Local restaurants showcase both traditional Spanish cuisine and contemporary European dining; weekly markets provide both practical shopping and social gathering points.\n\nThe village's elevation provides natural climate regulation and panoramic perspectives toward the Mediterranean and inland valleys. Proximity to Blue Flag beaches (within 20 minutes) offers swimming and water sports without the congestion of major resort zones. For golf enthusiasts, several championship courses operate within 30 minutes' drive. Healthcare access rivals Northern European standards, with English-speaking medical professionals and private clinics complementing the regional hospital infrastructure. Shopping, from daily necessities at Mercadona or Lidl to specialist boutiques, requires minimal travel. This combination of Mediterranean authenticity, established amenity infrastructure, and cosmopolitan community character defines the Finestrat lifestyle experience.",

This villa, priced at €3,838/m², commands a 74% premium over Finestrat's €2,200/m² average—justified by premium specification and optimal positioning. For investment-focused buyers, the property demonstrates rental potential typical of the market: €800 per week (€3,200+ monthly) for seasonal lettings, generating 5%+ annual returns. The pricing advantage relative to Spanish island markets (Balearics, Canaries) provides additional security; as European property values stabilize post-market volatility, comparative value positions Costa Blanca properties favorably. Finestrat's infrastructure development trajectory—improved connectivity, healthcare expansion, educational facilities—supports sustained appreciation.",
