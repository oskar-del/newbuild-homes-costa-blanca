    },
    {
      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Yes. Non-residents and non-EU citizens can purchase property in Spain without restrictions or special permissions. You require a Spanish NIE tax identification number for the transaction, which the solicitor typically obtains during the conveyancing process. EU citizens benefit from identical rights to Spanish nationals, while non-EU buyers need slightly more documentation but encounter no substantive barriers to property ownership."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quels sont les frais d'achat d'un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect acquisition costs of approximately 10-13% comprising transfer tax (6-8%), notary fees (0.5-1%), land registry fees (0.1%), and legal/administrative expenses (1-2%). Annual property maintenance includes IBI property tax (approximately 0.4% of cadastral value), community fees in developments (typically €200-400 monthly), and utilities. Professional conveyancing through a bilingual Spanish solicitor is essential and costs approximately €1,500-2,500."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel est le coût de la vie sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Monthly living costs for a villa resident typically range €2,500-4,500 depending on lifestyle preferences and property size. Expenses include utilities (€150-250), local taxes (€150-300), groceries (€400-600), dining and entertainment (€400-800), and discretionary spending. Premium villa residents often maintain higher budgets reflecting international healthcare insurance, school fees, and luxury lifestyle preferences, though overall costs remain substantially lower than equivalent Northern European residency."
    },
    {
      "question": "À quelle distance se trouve la Costa Blanca de la France ?",
      "answer": "Approximately 1,400 kilometres. Alicante-Elche Airport—58 kilometres from Sierra Cortina—connects directly to London and regional UK airports with flight times of 2-2.5 hours. Budget airlines provide frequent connections throughout the week, making UK access convenient for regular travel. Ferry alternatives exist via French ports but require 24+ hours including driving time, making air travel the practical option for most residents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel temps fait-il sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of annual sunshine, mild winters (10-15°C), and warm summers (25-30°C) moderated by sea breezes. Rainfall concentrates in autumn and spring with minimal winter precipitation. The elevated Sierra Cortina location benefits from natural air circulation, reducing summer temperatures compared to coastal lowlands. Winter temperatures remain suitable for year-round residency, though many residents migrate during July-August peak heat."
    },
    {
      "question": "Puis-je obtenir un prêt hypothécaire en Espagne en tant qu'étranger ?",
      "answer": "Yes. Multiple Spanish banks and international mortgage providers offer financing to non-resident property buyers, typically requiring 30-40% down payment with loan periods of 15-25 years. Interest rates currently range 3-4.5% depending on loan-to-value ratios and personal circumstances. UK mortgage brokers specialising in Spanish property finance streamline the application process, though EU-based lenders often provide more competitive terms for non-residents. Professional financial advice is essential given currency and tax implications."
    },
    {
      "question": "Ai-je besoin d'un visa pour acheter un bien en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "No. Property purchase requires no visa or residency status. You need only a Spanish NIE tax identification number, obtained through the purchasing solicitor or local tax office. Extended residency (golden visa) programmes exist for property investments exceeding €500,000, offering EU residency benefits. Most property buyers initially enter Spain on standard tourist visas before establishing residency status once property is secured."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much property tax do I pay annually in Spain?",
      "answer": "Annual IBI property tax varies by municipality and cadastral property valuation, typically ranging 0.3-0.8% of assessed value. Sierra Cortina properties in Finestrat (IBI approximately €4,000-6,000 annually on €4.45M property) are among Spain's more expensive municipalities due to premium location. Community development fees vary (€200-400 monthly typical), and annual wealth tax applies only to net assets exceeding €600,000. Professional accountants advise on tax optimisation strategies for international property owners."
