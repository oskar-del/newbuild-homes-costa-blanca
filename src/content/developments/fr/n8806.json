Within 15 km you'll find Lo Romero Golf (excellent testing course), La Marquesa Golf (scenic layout), and Vistabella Golf Course.

The La Finca membership system offers flexibility for renters and non-members."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Algorfa a good place to live?",
      "answer": "Yes, particularly for golfers and those seeking authentic Spanish village life with international amenities. Algorfa offers security, peaceful living, strong expat community, excellent climate, and proximity to beaches and services. It avoids coastal overcrowding while maintaining convenient access to everything—beaches 15 minutes, hospitals 20 minutes, shopping 10 minutes.

The on-site golf course guarantees year-round visitor demand from golfing tourists and tournament participants."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a car in Algorfa?",
      "answer": "Yes, a car is essential. Public transport is very limited in this village area. However, the wider region offers excellent road infrastructure, and Alicante Airport is just 45 minutes away. Parking is abundant and free. The trade-off—car dependency—is typical of inland Costa Blanca living but offset by peaceful driving conditions and minimal traffic congestion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is included with La Finca Golf community living?",
      "answer": "La Finca Golf is a gated, secure community offering the championship golf course, clubhouse with restaurant, pools (in community areas), social events, and tournaments throughout the year. Security is 24/7 with controlled access. Amenities depend on membership level, but the on-site course and clubhouse alone justify the location for golf-focused living. Residents enjoy direct access without green fee charges (membership dependent)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this property suitable for families?",
      "answer": "Yes. The 3 bedrooms accommodate families comfortably. International schools are accessible in nearby Torrevieja (25 minutes). The gated community offers security and safe environment for children. Beaches are 15 minutes away for family activities. The main consideration is car dependency—typical for inland Costa Blanca living. Many families thrive in this setup, appreciating the golf amenities and village peace."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Algorfa cheaper than coastal towns if it's premium specification?",
      "answer": "Location pricing. Coastal properties command premium prices due to scarcity and tourist demand. Algorfa, 15-20 minutes inland, avoids coastal congestion and inflation. The €2,348/m² price reflects excellent specification with inland location economics. You're effectively purchasing 'more house' for the same budget compared to beachfront properties. Market data shows Algorfa appreciating faster (+12% annually) than saturated coastal markets, suggesting pricing inefficiency in your favor."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the property investment tax implications for foreign buyers?",
      "answer": "Spanish property investment for non-residents involves annual wealth tax (typically 0.2-0.75%) and capital gains tax when selling. EU citizens enjoy residency options with more favorable treatment. Rental income is taxable but deductible for maintenance and management expenses. Professional tax advisors recommend establishing Spanish residency structures to optimize holdings. This villa's appreciation potential and rental income often offset tax obligations through long-term growth. Consult a Spanish property tax specialist for individual circumstances."
