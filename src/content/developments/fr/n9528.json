  "heroIntro": "Welcome to modern living in the heart of Torrevieja. This thoughtfully designed 1-bedroom apartment offers the perfect blend of contemporary comfort and beachside accessibility. Situated just 600 metres from the pristine Playa del Cura beach, you're mere steps away from the Mediterranean lifestyle while enjoying the convenience of city centre living.\n\nThis newly constructed apartment spans 57 square metres of intelligently planned space, ideal for couples, young professionals, or investors seeking a property in one of Costa Blanca's most vibrant coastal towns. The prime location in Centro Torrevieja means everyday necessities are within a 5-minute walk, from artisan bakeries to local tapas bars that define the Spanish coastal experience.\n\nTorrevieja has transformed significantly over the past decade, establishing itself as a cultural hub with year-round activities, excellent healthcare facilities, and a genuinely multicultural community. This apartment represents an opportunity to own a piece of this dynamic environment at an accessible price point, whether you're seeking a holiday retreat, permanent residence, or investment property.",
  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's rental market remains robust, particularly for central apartments within walking distance of the beach. The town attracts three distinct demographics: European retirees seeking permanent bases, families wanting holiday properties, and young professionals relocating for the lifestyle. A 1-bedroom apartment in Centro commands strong seasonal rental rates during summer months (June-September) while maintaining consistent off-season bookings from winter visitors escaping northern European climates.\n\nThe city has invested significantly in infrastructure and cultural amenities, hosting international events like the Habaneras Festival that draw thousands of visitors annually. This creates year-round rental opportunities and stable property values. For investors considering long-term appreciation, the strategic regeneration of Torrevieja's centre—including improved transport links and cultural facilities—suggests continued demand for centrally-located properties that combine affordability with location convenience.",
