  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's rental market has matured significantly beyond seasonal tourism, with growing demand for quality residential rentals from remote workers, retirees, and families seeking Mediterranean base camps. Aguas Nuevas specifically attracts higher-paying long-term renters—both expats and digital nomads—who prioritize modern finishes and quiet locations over beachfront proximity. Properties here consistently achieve stronger nightly rates than aging beach developments, with average occupancy during peak season (April-October) between 60-75% for well-managed homes.\n\nThe area's demographics favor investment longevity. Unlike beach developments dependent on tourist cycles, Aguas Nuevas draws permanent residents and long-term renters seeking stability, quality of life, and good value. Properties in established new developments have demonstrated 4-6% annual appreciation over recent years. The combination of limited inventory (only 31 homes), growing demand for contemporary housing, and Costa Blanca's expanding popularity with Northern European and international buyers suggests continued value growth for this villa.",

The area has attracted significant investment in new construction, with properties here commanding premium prices due to quality finishes and development standards. Torrevieja itself offers surprising cultural depth—from its salt lakes (one of Europe's most important natural reserves) to contemporary art museums and an expanding gastronomic scene that goes well beyond typical tourist fare.\n\nThe Costa Blanca's climate—over 300 sunny days annually—makes Aguas Nuevas an ideal year-round location. Unlike northern Europe, residents here enjoy outdoor living nine months of the year, and the area's elevation provides better air circulation than beachfront neighborhoods, reducing the stuffiness sometimes felt in seaside developments.",
