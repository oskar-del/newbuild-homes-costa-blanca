This natural landmark defines the region's character and provides stunning visual focal points throughout the town. The municipality benefits from exceptional climate conditions with over 300 days of annual sunshine, mild winters averaging 12°C, and refreshing sea breezes moderating summer temperatures. Calpe's strategic location between Valencia (120km north) and Alicante (70km south) offers excellent connectivity while maintaining its exclusive, quieter atmosphere compared to busier resorts. The town has evolved from a fishing village into a sophisticated Mediterranean destination, attracting affluent European residents who appreciate its perfect balance of coastal beauty, cultural heritage, and modern infrastructure.",
