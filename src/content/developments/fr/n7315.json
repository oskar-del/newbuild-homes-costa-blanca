  "areaSection": "Santa Pola is a coastal municipality in southern Alicante, located approximately 25km south of Alicante city. The town has transformed from a quiet fishing village into a thriving resort destination while maintaining its authentic Spanish character. Playa Tamarit, where this property is situated, benefits from multiple Blue Flag beaches within walking distance and excellent connectivity to wider Costa Blanca attractions. The region enjoys over 300 days of sunshine annually with mild winters and warm summers, creating ideal conditions for year-round holiday rentals. Santa Pola's strategic location between Alicante and Torrevieja makes it accessible yet less crowded than major tourist hotspots, contributing to its appeal among discerning investors.",

  "investmentSection": "Santa Pola's property market demonstrates solid fundamentals for investors. Year-on-year appreciation of 8% significantly outpaces inflation and provides genuine capital growth. Holiday rental demand remains consistently strong, with typical weekly rates of €800 generating annual gross rental income of approximately €41,600 for 52 weeks. Conservative occupancy assumptions of 65-70% yield realistic net rental returns of 12-15% annually after management and operational costs. This property's €2,534/m² valuation sits 15% above the Santa Pola average of €2,200/m², reflecting its premium specification and optimal location. Compared to Spanish island markets (Balearics, Canaries), this represents exceptional value—properties with identical specifications command 40% premium pricing. The combination of reasonable purchase price, strong rental income potential, and consistent capital appreciation makes this a strategically sound investment for buy-to-let portfolios.",
