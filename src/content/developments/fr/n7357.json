UK citizens post-Brexit typically obtain residency through non-lucrative visa (passive income), digital nomad visa, or retirement visa depending on circumstances. Your legal representative advises on residency options during the property purchase process, ensuring compliance with Spanish immigration requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Puis-je obtenir un prêt hypothécaire en Espagne en tant qu'étranger ?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners can obtain mortgages in Spain, though terms are generally stricter than for Spanish citizens. Spanish banks typically require 30-40% down payment (compared to 20% for nationals), proof of income, and often prefer borrowers with established Spanish tax numbers (NIE). Interest rates are competitive. Many international buyers prefer cash purchases, while others utilize UK mortgages on Spanish properties. Financial advisors familiar with expatriate purchases provide comparative analysis."

Properties in Monforte del Cid command approximately €800 per week during peak season (May-September), generating meaningful supplementary income. The secure Alenda Golf location appeals to holiday-seeking tourists, and property management companies in the area handle bookings, maintenance, and guest communication.
