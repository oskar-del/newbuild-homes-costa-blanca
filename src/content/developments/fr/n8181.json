  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Combien coûte ce bien immobilier ?",
      "answer": "€445,000. This 3-bedroom villa in Torre del Rame represents premium specification at standard Los Alcazares pricing. You can expect flexible payment arrangements, and as a foreign buyer, you can obtain a Spanish mortgage covering up to 80% of the purchase price through various lenders experienced with international clients."
    },
    {
      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Foreign nationals can purchase property in Spain without restrictions or special permits. You'll need an NIE (Spanish tax identification number), which is straightforward to obtain. British, German, Dutch, and other European nationals regularly purchase homes in Los Alcazares. Most vendors' solicitors handle the NIE application as part of the buying process. Non-EU citizens have slightly more documentation requirements but face no legal barriers to ownership."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quels sont les frais d'achat d'un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Beyond the €445,000 purchase price, expect approximately 8-10% in additional costs: 6% property transfer tax, 1.5% administration fees, €300-500 legal fees, and €200-400 notary costs. Mortgage origination fees (if financing) run 0.5-1%. These are standard across Spain and built into your purchase budget. Ongoing annual costs include 0.4-1.1% property tax and approximately €30-50 community fees if applicable, plus utilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Ai-je besoin d'un visa pour acheter un bien en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically to purchase property. EU/EEA nationals can stay indefinitely as residents. British nationals can remain 90 days visa-free within 180 days, though many apply for residence permits (very easy to obtain). Non-EU citizens may need tourist visas for the viewing/purchase trip but can own property. Once you establish Spanish tax residency (typically automatic if you spend more than 183 days annually), you can arrange longer-stay visas if desired."
    },
    {
      "question": "La Costa Blanca est-elle un bon endroit pour acheter un bien immobilier ?",
      "answer": "Yes, Costa Blanca remains one of Spain's strongest property markets, particularly for families and retirees. Los Alcazares specifically offers excellent value with established expat communities, strong infrastructure, and healthy 8% annual appreciation. Unlike overcrowded tourist areas, Los Alcazares maintains authenticity while providing modern amenities. The region's consistent weather, healthcare quality, and school options make it genuinely livable year-round, not just seasonal holiday destination."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel est le coût de la vie sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Living costs in Los Alcazares are 25-35% lower than Northern Europe. Groceries, dining out, utilities, and gasoline are all significantly cheaper. A family of four typically budgets €1,200-1,500 monthly for groceries, €400-600 for utilities, and €15-25 for restaurant meals. Healthcare and private school costs are also lower than comparable Northern European towns. Many families report their overall living expenses drop by 30% upon moving to Los Alcazares while maintaining identical or better quality of life."
    },
    {
      "question": "À quelle distance se trouve la Costa Blanca de la France ?",
      "answer": "Alicante Airport (30 minutes from Los Alcazares) has direct flights to London, Manchester, Birmingham, and other major UK airports, typically 2.5-3 hours flight time. Budget airlines (Ryanair, EasyJet, Wizz Air) offer regular routes, with return flights often available for €60-120 per person. Many families maintain UK connections, visiting 2-4 times annually or having family visit Spain. The ease of travel makes Los Alcazares practical for families wanting Mediterranean life while maintaining British family ties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel temps fait-il sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Los Alcazares enjoys Mediterranean climate with 300+ sunshine days annually. Summers (June-September) reach 28-32°C with very low rainfall. Winters are mild, 12-16°C, with occasional rain but rarely freezing. Spring and autumn are perfect—20-25°C with gentle breezes. This climate means outdoor family activities are possible year-round. Children can safely swim in Mar Menor from May through October, and winter months still offer pleasant beach days and outdoor play that Northern Europeans find remarkable after grey seasons at home."
    },
    {
      "question": "Puis-je obtenir un prêt hypothécaire en Espagne en tant qu'étranger ?",
      "answer": "Yes. Spanish banks routinely offer mortgages to foreign nationals, typically covering 70-80% of property value. Conditions are: proof of income, tax residency in Spain (easily established), and a clean credit history. Interest rates are competitive (currently 3-4%), often lower than UK mortgages. British citizens, other EU nationals, and even non-EU citizens can qualify. Your solicitor can recommend lenders experienced with international buyers. The process takes 4-6 weeks and is straightforward with proper documentation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is this villa priced at €445,000 when Los Alcazares average is €2,200/m²?",
      "answer": "This villa's €4,198/m² reflects premium specification—modern finishes, efficient layout, quality construction, and desirable location in Torre del Rame. Despite the premium over area average, it's 40% cheaper than equivalent homes on Mallorca or Ibiza, making it excellent value for premium-finish family living. The higher price-per-meter reflects quality rather than overpricing; comparable three-bedroom homes with similar finishes in established expatriate areas command these prices."
