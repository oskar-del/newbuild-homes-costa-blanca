  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Why are the lagoons in Torrevieja pink, and is this a permanent feature?",
      "answer": "The pink coloration comes from salt-loving algae and certain bacteria that thrive in the high-salinity environment. The intensity varies seasonally and by time of day—it's most vibrant during summer months and appears most striking during golden hour. This is a natural, permanent feature that has been part of Torrevieja's ecology for centuries and is now a protected nature reserve."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between ground-floor and upper-floor units in this development?",
      "answer": "Ground-floor bungalows feature private garden access, ideal for those who want direct outdoor space and easier landscaping. Upper-floor apartments include a solarium (private terrace), offering privacy, views, and the same outdoor living benefits. Both options provide equal living space and full access to community amenities."

You get the best of both worlds—choose your level of activity without needing to relocate."
