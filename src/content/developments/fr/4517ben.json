    {
      "question": "La Costa Blanca est-elle un bon endroit pour acheter un bien immobilier ?",
      "answer": "Yes. Costa Blanca demonstrates consistent 8% year-on-year market appreciation, attracts over 4 million annual visitors, and offers established expatriate communities with mature service infrastructure. The region represents excellent value compared to Spanish island markets (Balearics, Canaries) while providing Mediterranean lifestyle experiences. International residency pathways, favorable tax treatment for non-Spanish residents, and stable rental demand create compelling investment fundamentals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Yes. Foreign nationals can purchase property in Spain without visa requirements, though residency benefits vary by nationality. Non-EU citizens require Spanish tax identification numbers (NIF) for property transactions. UK nationals, EU citizens, and other international buyers regularly complete property purchases through Spanish notaries. Professional legal guidance ensures compliance with foreign investment regulations and optimizes tax positioning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quels sont les frais d'achat d'un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Spanish property acquisition typically incurs 7-10% total transaction costs including transfer tax (6-8%), notary fees (0.5-1%), registry fees (0.1%), and professional legal services (1-2%). These costs are payable by purchasers in addition to the property purchase price. Benissa's €2.995M property would therefore incur approximately €210,000-€300,000 in acquisition expenses. Professional advisors optimize timing and structuring to minimize overall tax exposure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel est le coût de la vie sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca offers exceptional value compared to Northern European countries. Monthly costs for a couple include €800-1,200 for utilities, €300-500 for groceries (using local markets and supermarkets), €200-400 for dining out, and €400-800 for leisure activities. Healthcare is heavily subsidized through Spanish public system for residents. Property ownership through mortgage generates lower costs than Northern European equivalents, with heating minimal and seasonal cooling required only summer months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Puis-je obtenir un prêt hypothécaire en Espagne en tant qu'étranger ?",
      "answer": "Yes. Major Spanish banks including BBVA, CaixaBank, Santander, and ING offer mortgages to foreign nationals with valid documentation. Typical terms include 70-80% loan-to-value ratios, interest rates of 3-4%, and 20-30 year amortization periods. Non-EU citizens require Spanish tax identification (NIF) and may need proof of income and funds for down payment. International mortgage advisors facilitate bank negotiations and optimize financing structures for non-Spanish buyers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Ai-je besoin d'un visa pour acheter un bien en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "No visa is required to purchase property in Spain for most international nationalities. However, residency benefits vary—EU citizens enjoy automatic residency rights, while non-EU buyers may qualify for Spain's Golden Visa (€500,000 minimum investment) enabling long-term residency. Property ownership alone doesn't confer residency; separate applications may be required depending on individual circumstances. Professional legal guidance clarifies visa requirements and residency pathways for your specific nationality."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Benissa good for retirees?",
      "answer": "Excellent. Benissa is specifically chosen by affluent retirees seeking authentic Spanish village living with international community infrastructure. Healthcare access includes English-speaking doctors, private clinics, and modern hospitals—essential for retirees. The established expatriate community (primarily British, German, Scandinavian) provides social networks, cultural familiarity, and support services. Mild climate eliminates heating costs; Mediterranean lifestyle emphasizes outdoor activities, fine dining, and leisurely pursuits. Property rental income supplements fixed pensions through tourist season lettings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel temps fait-il sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca experiences over 300 days of annual sunshine with mild winters (10-15°C minimum) and warm summers (28-32°C). Mediterranean breezes moderate temperature extremes, particularly in elevated properties like Benissa. November through March sees occasional rainfall (50-100mm monthly), while summer months remain virtually rain-free. The climate supports year-round outdoor living—swimming from June through October, Mediterranean walks and cultural activities during cooler months. Seasonal weather patterns minimize property maintenance costs compared to Northern European equivalents."
    },
    {
      "question": "À quelle distance se trouve la Costa Blanca de la France ?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is 1,200-1,400 kilometers from the UK, typically requiring 2-2.5 hour direct flights from London, Manchester, and other primary UK airports. Alicante-Elche Airport (95 minutes from Benissa) handles 40+ daily European flights, making regular UK travel convenient. Budget airlines (Ryanair, EasyJet, Wizz Air) offer competitive fares for frequent travelers. The region's accessibility supports part-time UK-based professionals and retirees maintaining family connections while enjoying Mediterranean residency."
