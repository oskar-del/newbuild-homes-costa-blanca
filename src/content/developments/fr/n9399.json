  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's property market has matured beyond speculative cycles, creating stable conditions for legitimate investors. The city attracts genuine end-users—Spanish nationals from northern regions seeking retirement homes, British professionals relocating for work, and German retirees prioritizing healthcare access and lifestyle quality. Unlike purely tourist-focused coastal areas, La Hoya's demographic diversity supports consistent rental demand across multiple seasons. Three-bedroom apartments particularly appeal to families and small groups booking weekly or monthly stays, while the neighborhood's quieter character attracts longer-term rental tenants seeking stability.\n\nThe rental yield potential reflects actual market conditions rather than inflated projections. Properties in this segment typically achieve 4-6% annual returns through tourist-season premium pricing combined with year-round resident rentals. Additionally, Torrevieja's growing reputation as a digital nomad hub creates demand for longer-term furnished rentals at rates exceeding traditional tourism models. The Spanish government's recent digital nomad visa initiatives have already begun driving this trend, with professionals increasingly choosing smaller cities offering affordability, climate, and connectivity.",

      "question": "Is Torrevieja practical for year-round living or primarily seasonal?",
