      "question": "Can I build a holiday rental property on this land?",
      "answer": "Yes. This land plot has full residential development rights, allowing construction of a villa suitable for holiday rental. Holiday villas in Moraira typically achieve €1,600+ weekly rental rates during peak season, providing strong income generation. Many property owners successfully operate holiday rentals through platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo while maintaining personal use during preferred seasons. Spanish tax implications and rental regulations should be reviewed with a local accountant."
    },

      "question": "What's the rental potential for Moraira properties?",
      "answer": "Comparable Moraira holiday villas achieve approximately €1,600 per week during summer season (June-September), with shoulder seasons (April-May, October) commanding €1,000-€1,200 weekly rates.

    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the build process typically take?",
      "answer": "Residential villa construction in Spain typically requires 18-24 months from initial permits through completion. This timeline includes preliminary project approval (3-4 months), detailed architectural plans and municipal permits (2-3 months), foundation and structure (8-10 months), and finishing phases (4-6 months). Working with established local builders and architects familiar with municipal requirements optimizes timelines. Your property purchase should include a timeline discussion with your chosen builder."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the property taxes and ongoing costs?",
      "answer": "Spanish property ownership involves annual property tax (IBI, approximately 0.4-0.8% of calculated value), municipal waste services (€200-300 annually), and water/electricity utilities. Buyers pay transfer tax (3-8% depending on region) upon purchase. Non-resident property owners may face additional non-resident income tax on rental properties. EU residents can establish residency, potentially reducing tax obligations. A Spanish accountant familiar with property ownership should guide your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between buying land versus finished property in Moraira?",
      "answer": "Land ownership provides complete creative control, custom design possibilities, and potentially higher appreciation as you develop the property. Finished properties offer immediate rental income and no construction timeline delays. Land typically appreciates 5%+ annually and allows building exactly to your specifications, while finished properties provide turnkey operation. This land's pricing and appreciation potential suit buyers valuing customization and long-term investment growth over immediate occupancy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there restrictions on foreign ownership?",
      "answer": "Spain welcomes foreign property ownership with minimal restrictions. EU citizens enjoy equivalent rights to Spanish nationals. Non-EU buyers must obtain a residence number (NIE) but face no purchase limitations. Brexit hasn't significantly affected UK buyer access. Hiring a Spanish property lawyer (gestoría) ensures compliance with all regulations. Your lawyer will handle deed registration, title verification, and tax documentation, essential for protecting your investment."
