  "metaDescription": "Exclusif 3-bedroom villa in Campana Garden, Finestrat. €699,000. Premium specification, 40% less than island markets. 225m² built, 556m² plot.",
  "heroIntro": "Discover an exceptional opportunity to acquire a premium villa in one of Costa Blanca's most sought-after developments. This sophisticated 3-bedroom residence in Campana Garden represents a discerning choice for international buyers seeking quality, exclusivity, and genuine value. Priced at €699,000—40% below comparable Spanish island markets—this property embodies premium specification at an accessible price point. With 225 square metres of meticulously designed living space set on a generous 556-square-metre plot, the villa offers the perfect balance of contemporary comfort and established community living. Finestrat has emerged as a preferred destination for sophisticated buyers who appreciate the refined Mediterranean lifestyle without the premium price tags associated with other coastal regions. The property's strategic location within Campana Garden places you within reach of championship golf courses, pristine Blue Flag beaches, and an established international community where English is widely spoken. This is not merely a purchase; it's an investment in a lifestyle that combines accessibility with authenticity.",
  "areaSection": "Finestrat is a charming hillside municipality positioned on the northern Costa Blanca, commanding views across the Mediterranean Sea. Located between the larger resort towns of Benidorm and Calpe, it benefits from the region's excellent year-round climate—approximately 300 days of sunshine annually—while maintaining a more relaxed, residential character. The area's topography creates distinct neighbourhoods, with Campana Garden representing a premium development that successfully blends suburban tranquility with convenient access to coastal amenities. The municipality has experienced significant infrastructure improvements over the past decade, attracting an increasingly international demographic of property owners. Finestrat's elevation and orientation provide natural advantages in terms of air quality and light, while its proximity to major transport links ensures connectivity without compromising the peaceful, established community atmosphere that distinguishes it from busier coastal alternatives.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Finestrat as a premium resident means embracing a measured pace without sacrificing sophistication. The established international community creates a natural environment where English speakers feel immediately at home, with numerous social networks, expat associations, and multilingual services available throughout the area. Your daily rhythm might include morning coffee at a local café overlooking Mediterranean vistas, afternoon visits to well-stocked supermarkets including Mercadona and Lidl, or explorations of traditional Spanish markets that operate throughout the week. Finestrat residents enjoy exceptional healthcare access, with private clinics and English-speaking medical professionals complementing the regional hospital located just 30 minutes away. The surrounding area offers sophisticated dining options ranging from traditional Spanish restaurants to international cuisine, while cultural activities, art galleries, and regular community events provide intellectual engagement. The proximity to multiple Blue Flag beaches—a 20-minute drive away—means that Mediterranean living is genuinely integrated into your routine rather than an occasional excursion.",
  "investmentSection": "This villa presents compelling investment fundamentals for discerning buyers. Priced at €3,107 per square metre, it commands a 41% premium above Finestrat's €2,200/m² average—justified by its premium specification and established community standing. The Costa Blanca market demonstrates robust momentum, with consistent 8% year-on-year appreciation reflecting strengthening international demand. Rental potential proves particularly attractive, with comparable properties achieving €800 per week during peak season, translating to approximately €35,000-€40,000 in annual rental income. The property's three-bedroom configuration appeals to families and larger groups, commanding premium rates during summer months and school holidays. Finestrat's position as a secondary market to Benidorm and Calpe creates genuine value arbitrage for investors—comparable properties in those municipalities command 35-45% premiums. Whether pursued as a personal Mediterranean base or incorporated into a diversified property portfolio, the combination of appreciation potential, rental yield, and lifestyle utility presents a sophisticated investment proposition.",
  "conclusion": "This villa represents a sophisticated acquisition opportunity for international buyers seeking premium Mediterranean living at genuine value. The combination of professional specification, established community positioning, proven rental potential, and consistent market appreciation creates compelling fundamentals for both lifestyle and investment objectives. Finestrat's emergence as a preferred secondary market offers the authentic Mediterranean experience without the premium pricing of more established resort areas.

    {
      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Ai-je besoin d'un visa pour acheter un bien en Espagne ?",

Non-EU citizens can obtain long-stay visas through various pathways including investment, retirement, or employment. EU citizens have freedom of movement and establishment rights. Consult with Spanish immigration specialists for your specific circumstances."
    },
    {

      "answer": "Annual property tax (IBI) typically ranges from 0.4-1.1% of the property's registered cadastral value. This varies by municipality and property classification. At the point of sale, you'll pay transfer tax of 6-11% depending on region. Spain's tax regime for foreign property owners is transparent and competitive relative to other European property markets. Professional advisors can provide precise calculations for your specific property."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel est le coût de la vie sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Cost of living in Costa Blanca is generally 20-30% lower than comparable northern European regions and significantly less than major UK cities. Groceries, dining, utilities, and services are affordable, particularly outside peak tourist areas. Healthcare costs are reasonable whether through public system or private insurance. The combination of lower living costs and Mediterranean climate makes the region financially attractive for retirees and remote workers."
    },
    {
      "question": "La Costa Blanca est-elle adaptée aux retraités ?",
      "answer": "Excellent. Costa Blanca attracts substantial retiree populations due to climate (300+ days sunshine), affordable healthcare, lower cost of living, and established international communities with English-speaking services. Healthcare infrastructure meets international standards with both public and private options. Tax treatment of pensions is generally favourable. The region offers both active lifestyle opportunities (golf, beaches, cultural activities) and peaceful residential communities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel temps fait-il sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Exceptional. Costa Blanca experiences approximately 300 days of sunshine annually with mild winters (average 15-18°C) and warm summers (28-32°C). Rainfall is minimal, concentrated in spring and autumn. The Mediterranean climate supports year-round outdoor living and eliminates the extreme weather patterns found in northern Europe. This consistent weather contributes to both quality of life and property appreciation."
    },
    {
      "question": "À quelle distance se trouve la Costa Blanca de la France ?",
      "answer": "Alicante Airport (50 minutes from this property) offers direct flights to most major UK airports, typically 2.5-3 hours flight time. Budget airlines provide frequent connections with competitive pricing. The region's accessibility via air transport makes it convenient for UK property owners maintaining international connections. Ferry services from southern Spain provide alternative connectivity for those transporting vehicles."
