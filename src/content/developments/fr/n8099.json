The area has transformed into a cosmopolitan golf community, attracting international players and enthusiasts who prefer a more relaxed setting than crowded beachfront developments. Its elevation and inland location provide relief from coastal humidity while maintaining easy access to beaches at Guardamar (15 minutes) and La Mata (20 minutes). The property market here has demonstrated consistent growth, with values increasing 12% year-on-year, reflecting strong demand from golf-focused buyers seeking authentic community over tourist infrastructure.",

Your daily routine might involve an early round at La Finca Golf, followed by café con leche at the village square, lunch at one of several excellent Spanish restaurants, then perhaps another nine holes before sunset. The international golf community creates natural networking opportunities—many residents have relocated specifically for the championship courses and English-speaking clubhouse culture. Weekends bring friendly tournaments, mixers at various clubs, and gatherings at the 19th hole where you'll discover fellow enthusiasts from the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and beyond. Shopping is convenient with Mercadona just 10 minutes away in Rojales, while more extensive retail and dining exists in Torrevieja (20 minutes). The expat community is well-established with excellent English-language services, medical care with English-speaking practitioners, and international schools readily accessible. Beaches remain within 15-20 minutes for those seeking Mediterranean swimming, while the village itself provides restaurants, bars, and social venues centered on the golfing lifestyle.",
