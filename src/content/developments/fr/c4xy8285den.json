The town combines authentic Spanish coastal character with sophisticated European infrastructure, making it distinct from more commercialised Costa Blanca destinations. Blessed with over 300 days of annual sunshine and temperate winters, Denia's climate supports the cultivation of local specialities, particularly red prawns (gambas rojas) that define its culinary identity. The town's strategic location provides proximity to both Ibiza and Valencia, whilst maintaining a refined, less-crowded atmosphere than neighbouring resorts.
