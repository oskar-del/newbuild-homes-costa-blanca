The town enjoys 300 days of sunshine yearly, with mild winters and warm summers—perfect for outdoor living. The geography is ideal: you're close enough to major amenities but far enough from mass tourism.

    {
      "question": "Combien coûte ce bien immobilier ?",
      "answer": "€359,900. This covers a premium-specification 3-bedroom villa in an established family neighborhood. At €2,812/m², you're paying well below island market rates while gaining property with strong rental potential (€800/week typical) and documented market growth of 8% year-on-year."
    },
    {
      "question": "Les étrangers peuvent-ils acheter un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Non-Spanish EU citizens and international buyers can purchase property in Spain without restrictions. You'll need a Spanish tax number (NIE), but the process is straightforward with a Spanish lawyer's assistance. Many British families own property here; legal frameworks are well-established and predictable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quels sont les frais d'achat d'un bien immobilier en Espagne ?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect: 6-8% property transfer tax, legal fees (€1,500-3,000), notary fees (€500-1,000), and registry fees (€300-600). Total closing costs typically run 8-10% of purchase price. Annual costs include: property tax (€100-300 for this property), utilities (€100-150/month), and maintenance. These are substantially lower than UK equivalents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Puis-je obtenir un prêt hypothécaire en Espagne en tant qu'étranger ?",
      "answer": "Yes. Spanish banks routinely mortgage to foreign residents and non-residents. Expect to provide proof of income, bank statements, and undergo Spanish credit checks. Interest rates are competitive (2.5-3.5% currently), and you can typically borrow 70-80% of property value. Work with an English-speaking mortgage broker familiar with foreigner applications."
    },
    {
      "question": "La Costa Blanca est-elle un bon endroit pour acheter un bien immobilier ?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is excellent for family relocation and investment. The region offers established international communities, quality healthcare, international schools, and proven rental markets. Unlike tourist-only areas, towns like Los Nietos balance international amenities with authentic local character. Price growth is consistent, and living costs are genuinely lower than Northern Europe."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel est le coût de la vie sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Daily costs run 30-40% below UK levels. Grocery shopping is significantly cheaper, utilities cost €100-150/month, dining out is affordable (€8-12 per person), and healthcare costs are minimal. Families report their monthly budget—housing, food, utilities, and insurance—costs €1,500-2,000. This property's running costs should be €150-200/month for utilities, plus annual property tax around €150-250."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Costa Blanca good for families?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is specifically family-friendly. You'll find international schools, safe neighborhoods, healthcare quality, beaches suitable for children, and an established expat community with school networks and family activities. Towns like Los Nietos were essentially built for families seeking relocation—not for transient tourists. Most families report better work-life balance and lower stress compared to Northern Europe."
    },
    {
      "question": "Quel temps fait-il sur la Costa Blanca ?",
      "answer": "Expect 300 days of sunshine yearly, with mild winters (12-15°C average) and warm summers (28-32°C). Rainfall is minimal and concentrated in autumn/spring. Beach swimming is comfortable April-November. The climate is genuinely Mediterranean—sun without excessive heat most months. Children thrive in this environment, and outdoor living extends throughout the year."
    },
    {
      "question": "À quelle distance se trouve la Costa Blanca de la France ?",
      "answer": "Alicante airport, 90 minutes from Los Nietos, offers direct flights to London (2.5 hours flight time). Budget airlines make UK visits affordable—typically £50-100 return if booked ahead. Many families maintain UK connections, visiting twice yearly. The distance is manageable for family life while providing escape from UK weather and costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes this specific property suitable for families?",
      "answer": "This villa combines practical family living with financial sense. Three separate bedrooms suit growing children, three bathrooms eliminate morning conflicts, and the fenced 228m² plot provides safe outdoor space. The neighborhood is genuinely family-oriented, nearby international schools follow British curriculum, and Blue Flag beaches are 20 minutes away. At €359,900, you're gaining a home—not a renovation project—at proven investment prices."
