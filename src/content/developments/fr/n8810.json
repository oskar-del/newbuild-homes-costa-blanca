The coastline features multiple Blue Flag beaches within 20 minutes, providing world-class water access.

Total additional costs typically range 8-12% of purchase price. Ongoing costs include annual property tax (0.4-1.1% of cadastral value), community fees (if applicable), and utilities.

Rental income from investment properties incurs standard taxation (19-45% progressive rates). Non-resident property owners pay 19% annual taxation on imputed rental income.
