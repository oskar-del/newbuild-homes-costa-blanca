At €875,000, this property delivers sophisticated architecture and refined finishes on a substantial 322m² plot, offering the space and privacy that defines luxury coastal living.

  "areaSection": "Alfas del Pi sits on the northern Costa Blanca, positioning itself as an established enclave of sophisticated coastal living approximately 40 kilometres north of Alicante airport. The municipality enjoys a Mediterranean climate with 300+ days of annual sunshine, moderate winters averaging 14°C, and warm summers tempered by coastal breezes. The topography ranges from coastal flatlands to gentle hillside locations offering panoramic views across the Mediterranean toward Benidorm and beyond. This geographic position provides genuine distinction: proximity to urban amenities and international infrastructure combined with the tranquility of a mature, established residential community. The area has historically attracted Northern European buyers and long-term residents who value the balance between accessibility and genuine Mediterranean character—avoiding both tourist saturation and isolated remoteness.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Alfas del Pi revolves around a sophisticated balance of convenience and leisure. The established international community—primarily British, German, and Scandinavian residents—creates an environment where English is widely spoken, yet Spanish culture remains authentic and accessible. Residents enjoy morning swims at multiple Blue Flag beaches within 20 minutes, followed by leisurely shopping at local markets or the Mercadona supermarket stocked with both local and international provisions. The healthcare infrastructure caters to expatriate needs with English-speaking doctors at private clinics and the regional hospital 30 minutes away. Afternoons might include golf at championship courses nearby, cultural activities in nearby Altea, or dining at the growing selection of restaurants serving international and Mediterranean cuisine. The established expat infrastructure means practical matters—from tax advice to property management—are easily navigated through English-speaking professionals. Yet beneath this accessibility lies a genuinely Spanish community: weekly markets, local festivals, and the rhythms of Mediterranean life remain central to the experience.",
  "investmentSection": "This property operates on compelling investment fundamentals alongside lifestyle appeal. The Costa Blanca's 8% year-on-year appreciation trend reflects growing recognition of the region's value—particularly as prices on Spanish islands have become prohibitive. The €4,310 per square metre valuation positions this villa advantageously against premium-specification alternatives: 40% below Balearic and Canary Island comparables, yet among quality construction standards rather than budget alternatives. Rental potential strengthens the investment case: €800 weekly rental income represents approximately 3.7% gross yield, achievable through both seasonal lettings and long-term expat arrangements. Alfas del Pi's established international community ensures consistent demand from renters seeking cultural authenticity combined with accessible infrastructure. For investors evaluating European property markets, this combination—appreciation potential, rental income, and substantially lower entry price than traditional Mediterranean prestige markets—merits serious portfolio consideration.",
  "conclusion": "This exceptional 4-bedroom villa in Alfas del Pi merits serious consideration for discerning buyers evaluating Mediterranean property investment. The combination of premium specification, substantial plot, strong rental potential, and appreciating market fundamentals creates compelling value—particularly for those recognizing that Costa Blanca investment opportunities represent genuine alternatives to inflated Spanish island pricing. The established international community provides immediate social and practical infrastructure, while the location maintains authentic Mediterranean character.
