  "metaTitle": "€1.195M Luxury 3-Bed Villa Campoamor, Orihuela Costa",
  "metaDescription": "Exclusif 3-bedroom villa in prestigious Campoamor. Premium specification, 193m² built, 500m² plot. 35% below Costa Blanca Nord prices.",
  "heroIntro": "This exceptional 3-bedroom villa in Campoamor represents a sophisticated investment opportunity for discerning buyers seeking premium Mediterranean living at unprecedented value. Priced at €1,195,000, this property exemplifies the caliber of construction and design that attracts international luxury buyers to Orihuela Costa's most prestigious developments. What truly distinguishes this villa is its positioning within the market: at €6,192 per square meter, you're acquiring premium specification—comparable to developments commanding significantly higher premiums further north along the Costa Blanca—yet enjoying a remarkable 35% reduction versus comparable properties in Costa Blanca Norte. This isn't merely a financial advantage; it represents the evolution of Orihuela Costa as a destination for those who understand value doesn't diminish exclusivity. Built across 193 square meters on an expansive 500-square-meter plot, the property offers the spatial generosity and privacy expected by affluent buyers, positioning you within a select community of international residents who have discovered this region's distinctive appeal. The strong +10% year-on-year appreciation trend underscores the investment merit, while the location itself—proximate to championship golf courses, Blue Flag beaches, and essential amenities—delivers the lifestyle credentials that transcend mere real estate transactions.",
  "areaSection": "Campoamor occupies a distinctive position within Orihuela Costa, representing the region's most established and internationally recognized development. Situated on the southern reaches of the Costa Blanca, this area enjoys a Mediterranean microclimate characterized by 320+ days of annual sunshine, temperate winters, and the moderating influence of the Mediterranean Sea. The geography itself—slightly elevated terrain offering potential for commanding vistas—creates natural separation from congested coastal areas while maintaining convenient access to beaches and amenities. Campoamor developed initially around its championship golf course, attracting a sophisticated international community predominantly from Northern Europe, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavia. This legacy of selective development has preserved a distinctly upscale character, distinguishing it from more commercialized sections of the Costa Blanca. The area's orientation toward mature, discerning residents has resulted in superior infrastructure, enhanced security protocols, and a cosmopolitan community where English is universally spoken among service providers and resident populations.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Campoamor means inhabiting a carefully curated Mediterranean enclave where daily life balances tranquility with sophisticated amenities. Your morning might begin with golf on the adjacent championship course before browsing the extensive selection at La Zenia Boulevard, one of southern Spain's premier shopping destinations, accessible within minutes. The region's strong expat infrastructure—predominantly British, Scandinavian, and Dutch communities—ensures seamless integration, with English spoken across healthcare facilities, restaurants, and service providers. Evenings reveal Orihuela Costa's true character: a succession of Blue Flag beaches including La Zenia and Campoamor itself, lined with sophisticated restaurants serving everything from traditional Spanish cuisine to international fare. The community calendar reflects this cosmopolitan character, with numerous social organizations, cultural events, and recreational clubs creating an active social fabric without the frenetic pace of major urban centers. Healthcare access rivals that of major cities, with English-speaking practitioners throughout the region. This is lifestyle living calibrated for those prioritizing quality of life, sophisticated amenities, and genuine community over resort-style transience.",
  "investmentSection": "Orihuela Costa has demonstrated consistent appreciation, with the regional market advancing 10% year-on-year—a performance that reflects growing international recognition and infrastructure investment. This villa's valuation at €6,192 per square meter, 35% below comparable Costa Blanca North properties, positions it within an appreciating market segment where supply remains constrained relative to international demand. Rental potential substantiates the investment thesis: comparable properties in the area typically generate €800+ weekly rental income during peak season, translating to approximately €30,000-€40,000 annual returns—attractive yield for European investors seeking Mediterranean exposure. The property's three-bedroom configuration suits both primary residence and investment-income profiles, while its location appeals to the demographic cohorts driving regional growth: retired professionals, semi-retirees, and established business owners from Northern Europe. Market analysis suggests continued appreciation as infrastructure improvements, healthcare facility expansions, and enhanced connectivity to Alicante continue developing.",
  "conclusion": "This exceptional villa in Campoamor represents precisely the opportunity discerning international buyers pursue: premium specification, established community, and demonstrated investment appreciation at genuinely accessible pricing. The combination of Mediterranean lifestyle, sophisticated amenities, and consistent market validation creates a compelling profile for primary residence, secondary property, or investment portfolio diversification. The +10% annual appreciation trajectory, rental income potential, and lifestyle authenticity distinguish this opportunity from speculative projects or commoditized developments. Whether your priority emphasizes year-round Mediterranean residence, semi-retirement lifestyle, or investment portfolio exposure to appreciating European real estate, this villa delivers the execution quality and community positioning expected at this price point.

The motorway infrastructure (AP-7, N-332) enables rapid transit throughout the Costa Blanca and inland Spain. Within the community itself, distances remain modest—Villamartín Golf, La Zenia Beach, and primary amenities occupy 5-15 minute drives. Parking throughout Campoamor is universally available, reflecting low-density development patterns. This transportation reality appeals specifically to residents prioritizing autonomy and flexibility over reliance on public systems.",
