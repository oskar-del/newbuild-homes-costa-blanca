    },
    {
      "question": "Können Ausländer Immobilien in Spanien kaufen?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Non-EU and EU foreigners have the same property purchase rights as Spanish citizens. You'll need an NIE (Spanish tax identification number), which takes 10-15 minutes to obtain at your local police station. Most transactions proceed smoothly with proper legal representation, which we recommend."
    },
    {
      "question": "Welche Kosten fallen beim Immobilienkauf in Spanien an?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect 6-8% in total acquisition costs including 3% transfer tax, 1.5% property registration, legal fees (1-2%), and surveyor costs. Mortgage arrangements typically cost 0.5-1% in origination fees. Annual property tax is approximately 0.4-1.1% of property value. Our legal team provides transparent cost breakdowns before proceeding."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wie hoch sind die Grundsteuern in Spanien?",

Capital gains tax applies only if you sell at profit, calculated on the appreciation amount rather than full sale price. Non-resident property owners pay slightly higher rates but still very reasonable by international standards."

      "answer": "Yes, many Spanish banks offer mortgages to foreign buyers, typically up to 80% of property value at competitive rates currently around 3-4%. You'll need proof of income, employment history, and credit documentation. Alternatively, many UK buyers use Spanish mortgages for their favorable rates or UK mortgages through lenders offering Spanish property financing. We connect you with experienced mortgage advisors."
