    },
    {
      "question": "Brauche ich ein Visum, um Immobilien in Spanien zu kaufen?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically for property purchase. Non-EU citizens simply need a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and follow standard property procedures. However, residency intentions may trigger visa requirements for extended stays. EU/UK citizens (post-Brexit) can stay 90 days visa-free, with longer stays requiring appropriate visas. Most property buyers consult Spanish solicitors regarding residency options. Purchasing property doesn't automatically grant residency but opens pathways to residency programs."
