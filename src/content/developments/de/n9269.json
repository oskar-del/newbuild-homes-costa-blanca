    },
    {
      "question": "Brauche ich ein Visum, um Immobilien in Spanien zu kaufen?",

For permanent residence, you'll need either a residence visa (requiring proof of income €1,350+/month for families) or apply through residency-by-investment programs.

UK retirees often leverage savings rather than mortgages. You'll need proof of income, credit history, and an NIE number. Current rates average 3.5-4.5% fixed. Many buyers arrange mortgages within their country of origin instead, which provides currency stability."

Winters (December-February) are mild—12-17°C—rarely requiring heating. Spring and autumn are ideal 20-25°C with occasional rain. This climate suits families transitioning from UK winters, requiring only lightweight clothing year-round. Beach swimming is comfortable April-November."
