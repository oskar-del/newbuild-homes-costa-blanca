  "metaTitle": "1 Schlafzimmer Apartment Aguilas €290,000 - Investment Property",
  "metaDescription": "€290,000 1-bedroom apartment Isla Del Fraile, Aguilas. High rental yield potential, 40% below island market prices. Investment opportunity.",
  "heroIntro": "This 62m² one-bedroom apartment in Isla Del Fraile represents a compelling investment opportunity in Aguilas, Murcia's emerging property market. Priced at €290,000 (€4,677/m²), it sits 40% below comparable Spanish island markets while maintaining premium specifications and finishes. The Costa Blanca region has experienced consistent 8% year-on-year appreciation, and Aguilas specifically offers significant upside potential with an average market price of just €2,200/m². For investors seeking rental income, this property commands approximately €800 per week on the holiday let market, translating to strong cash-on-cash returns. The established expat community and international infrastructure make this an accessible entry point for UK and European buyers seeking both capital appreciation and ongoing rental revenue. With 39 images documenting the property's condition and location, this turnkey investment requires minimal preparation for immediate lettings.",
  "areaSection": "Aguilas is a charming Mediterranean coastal town in Murcia, located in southeastern Spain along the Costa Blanca. The town benefits from 320+ days of annual sunshine, mild winters, and warm summers, creating an ideal climate for both permanent residents and holiday visitors. Aguilas sits within 30 minutes of major amenities while maintaining authentic Spanish character without the over-development of nearby tourist hotspots. The town's strategic position on the Murcia coast provides direct beach access and serves as a natural hub between Almería and Alicante provinces. Local infrastructure has modernized considerably, with reliable utilities, broadband connectivity, and comprehensive healthcare facilities. The region's dramatic coastal landscape, featuring limestone cliffs and protected coves, distinguishes Aguilas from flatter coastal alternatives and appeals strongly to the leisure and retirement markets.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Aguilas centers around Mediterranean practicality and leisure. The established expat community means English speakers are readily available in most service industries, banks, and healthcare facilities, reducing barriers to settlement. Fresh produce flows daily through local markets where both supermarkets (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum) and traditional Spanish markets operate side-by-side, keeping living costs moderate. The town's blue flag beaches provide immediate recreation, while championship golf courses operate within 20 minutes for leisure-focused residents. Healthcare access is straightforward—a regional hospital operates within 30 minutes, with private clinics offering English-speaking doctors throughout Aguilas. Restaurants, cafes, and bars reflect Spanish culture while accommodating international preferences. The pace is deliberate and social rather than rushed, with strong community connections forming naturally. Transport is accessible via local bus connections, though a car provides optimal flexibility for exploring the broader Costa Blanca region.",
  "investmentSection": "The investment case for this property rests on three pillars: valuation, yield, and appreciation. At €4,677/m², the property costs 40% less than equivalent Spanish island markets (Balearics, Canaries) while offering identical rental demographics. Aguilas' market has appreciated 8% year-on-year, substantially above Spanish national averages of 3-4%, indicating strong capital growth trajectory. Holiday rental demand remains robust, with weekly lettings commanding €800+ during peak season (June-September) and €450-600 during shoulder months. Annual gross rental income typically reaches €20,000-€25,000, delivering 7-8% gross yield on the €290,000 purchase price before management costs. The low property price enables portfolio diversification—investors can acquire multiple units with capital that would purchase a single property in established markets. Aguilas' positioning as an emerging destination (compared to saturated Torremolinos or Benalmádena) suggests sustained demand growth as international awareness expands.",
  "conclusion": "This €290,000 one-bedroom apartment in Isla Del Fraile represents a focused investment opportunity combining favorable valuation, strong rental yields, and capital appreciation potential within an emerging Costa Blanca market. The 40% discount versus island markets, consistent 8% year-on-year appreciation, and €800/week holiday rental demand deliver compelling returns for investors seeking both cash flow and wealth growth. Aguilas provides practical infrastructure—beaches within 3km, reliable healthcare, modern amenities, and an established expat community reducing operational complexity. The efficient 62m² layout requires minimal management while commanding premium holiday rates. For investors seeking geographic diversification, portfolio expansion, or Mediterranean income streams, this property merits serious consideration.
