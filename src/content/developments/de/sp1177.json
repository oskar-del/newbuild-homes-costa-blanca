Blessed with over 300 days of sunshine annually, it boasts a temperate climate that eliminates harsh winters. The town itself maintains authentic Spanish character while embracing its large international population—a unique blend that creates a welcoming atmosphere for newcomers.

The region benefits from excellent infrastructure, modern healthcare facilities, and a growing number of international amenities. Property prices here remain refreshingly reasonable compared to coastal hotspots, making it increasingly popular with retirees and investors seeking value. The surrounding countryside features rolling hills, almond groves, and championship golf courses—creating a picturesque backdrop for daily life.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Orihuela means joining a peaceful community that celebrates life at a comfortable pace. Your days might begin with coffee at a local café where English conversations flow naturally among the established expat community. Mid-morning could bring a round of golf at one of several championship courses nearby, followed by lunch at authentic Spanish restaurants or modern establishments catering to international tastes. The weekly markets—particularly in the town center—offer fresh produce, fish, and local specialties at reasonable prices. Supermarkets like Mercadona, Lidl, and Consum provide familiar shopping experiences. Afternoons often involve exploring nearby Blue Flag beaches, enjoying leisurely walks, or socializing with friends in the relaxed expat community. Healthcare is readily accessible with private clinics offering English-speaking doctors and a regional hospital within 30 minutes. Evenings showcase the Spanish tradition of paseos (walks) through town, dining with friends, or enjoying cultural events.

Orihuela's property market has appreciated 8% year-on-year, outpacing national averages and demonstrating sustained demand.

Many buyers utilize this income to offset mortgage costs or property expenses. The established expat community ensures consistent rental demand from visitors seeking authentic Costa Blanca experiences.
