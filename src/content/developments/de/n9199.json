  "metaDescription": "Modern 52m² apartment near Playa del Cura in Torrevieja. Exklusiv new development, perfect for beachside living on Costa Blanca.",
  "heroIntro": "Located just 250 meters from Playa del Cura, this modern 1-bedroom apartment offers an exceptional opportunity to own a slice of Costa Blanca's most vibrant beachside living. Ref N9199 sits within an exclusive development of 12 carefully designed apartments in the heart of Torrevieja, a town that has transformed from a traditional fishing village into one of Spain's most sought-after Mediterranean destinations.\n\nThis 52m² apartment combines smart design with genuine functionality. The layout maximizes natural light and living space, making it feel considerably larger than its compact footprint suggests. With direct proximity to Playa del Cura's golden sands and crystalline waters, daily beach access becomes a lifestyle reality rather than a weekend luxury. The location puts you mere minutes from Torrevieja's bustling paseo marítimo, where restaurants, bars, and cultural attractions define the social heartbeat of the town.\n\nThe apartment sits within a broader neighborhood transformation that has attracted both permanent residents seeking a Mediterranean lifestyle and savvy investors recognizing Torrevieja's rental market potential. This exclusive 12-unit development emphasizes quality over quantity, ensuring a peaceful residential setting while maintaining walkable access to everything the beachfront community offers.",
  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's tourism economy remains robust, with visitor numbers consistently strong across all seasons. The town attracts a diverse demographic—sun-seeking European tourists during summer months, retirees seeking permanent Mediterranean residences, and increasingly, digital workers prioritizing lifestyle over traditional office locations. This diverse demand creates multiple rental income streams: short-term tourist rentals during peak season, mid-term contracts from seasonal visitors, and stable long-term tenant situations from residents relocating to the Costa Blanca.\n\nThe beachfront location near Playa del Cura commands premium rental rates compared to inland properties. A well-maintained 1-bedroom apartment in this location typically achieves 4-5 months of strong seasonal rental income, with shoulder-season bookings at slightly reduced rates filling additional months. Beyond rental potential, the property benefits from Torrevieja's ongoing infrastructure improvements and its position as an increasingly recognized permanent residence destination rather than purely seasonal tourism hub.",
