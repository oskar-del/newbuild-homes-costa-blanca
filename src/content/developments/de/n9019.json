  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Wie viel kostet diese Immobilie?",
      "answer": "€397,500. This 3-bedroom villa in San Fulgencio is priced at €4,015 per square meter, representing exceptional value—40% less expensive than comparable properties in Spanish island markets like Mallorca and Menorca. Payment options and financing are available for qualified buyers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Ist die Costa Blanca ein guter Ort zum Immobilienkauf?",
      "answer": "Yes, Costa Blanca is an excellent investment location. The region offers diverse property options, established international communities, Mediterranean climate, and consistent market appreciation (8% annually in areas like San Fulgencio). Affordability combined with lifestyle benefits makes it particularly attractive for families relocating from Northern Europe."
    },
    {
      "question": "Können Ausländer Immobilien in Spanien kaufen?",
      "answer": "Yes, non-EU citizens can purchase property in Spain without restrictions. The process is straightforward: you'll need an NIE (Tax Identification Number), open a Spanish bank account, and complete a simple notarial deed. Most UK buyers find the process smooth with proper legal guidance. EU citizens have identical rights to Spanish citizens."
    },
    {
      "question": "Welche Kosten fallen beim Immobilienkauf in Spanien an?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect 6-10% additional costs: property transfer tax (3%), notary fees (0.5%), land registry fees (0.5%), and legal fees (1-2%). Stamp duty varies by region. Annual costs include property tax (typically 0.4-1.1% of cadastral value), community fees (if applicable), and utilities. Costs are substantially lower than UK equivalents."
    },
    {
      "question": "Brauche ich ein Visum, um Immobilien in Spanien zu kaufen?",
      "answer": "No, purchasing property does not require a visa. However, living in Spain as a non-EU citizen requires separate residency arrangements. UK nationals typically use the Withdrawal Agreement residency status or apply for a long-stay visa. Property ownership is independent of residency status, though residency affects tax implications."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wie hoch sind die Grundsteuern in Spanien?",
      "answer": "Annual property tax (IBI - Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles) ranges from 0.4% to 1.1% of the cadastral value, typically lower than the property's actual market value. This makes Spanish property tax competitive internationally. Rental income tax applies if you're generating income; property ownership alone incurs minimal tax beyond the annual IBI."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kann ich als Ausländer eine Hypothek in Spanien bekommen?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers can secure mortgages in Spain. Spanish banks typically offer 60-80% financing for non-residents, with interest rates competitive internationally (currently 3-4%). You'll need proof of income, a valid passport, an NIE, and a Spanish bank account. Many expats successfully finance Spanish property purchases."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wie hoch sind die Lebenshaltungskosten an der Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca offers affordable living compared to Northern Europe. Monthly costs for a family of four typically range €1,500-2,500, including rent or mortgage, utilities, groceries, and transport. Healthcare costs are minimal with Spanish residency insurance. Dining, entertainment, and travel are significantly cheaper than UK equivalents, making retirement or family living budget-friendly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wie weit ist die Costa Blanca von Deutschland entfernt?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is 1,200 kilometers from the UK. Alicante Airport has direct flights to most UK cities (2-2.5 hours flight time). Regular budget and scheduled flights make visiting family straightforward and affordable. Many expat families maintain close UK connections while enjoying Mediterranean living."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the weather like in Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys Mediterranean climate with 300+ days of sunshine annually. Summers are warm (28-35°C), winters mild (8-15°C), and rainfall minimal (concentrated in autumn/spring). The climate is ideal for outdoor family activities year-round, with swimming possible 8-9 months annually. This weather consistency is a major appeal for families relocating from cooler northern climates."
