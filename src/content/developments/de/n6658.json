  "areaSection": "Orihuela is a vibrant town in southern Alicante, sitting just 15 minutes from the Mediterranean coast while maintaining the authentic character of inland Costa Blanca living. This strategic location gives families the best of both worlds: peaceful residential neighbourhoods away from the tourist hustle, combined with beach access whenever you want it. The town benefits from a temperate climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually, making outdoor living a genuine lifestyle feature. Orihuela's geography positions it perfectly between Alicante airport (45 minutes) and the quieter resort areas of the south coast, while major shopping centers and healthcare facilities are all within easy driving distance. The region experiences steady population growth as families discover that coastal living doesn't mean tourist overcrowding—Orihuela maintains authentic Spanish community feel with modern amenities.",
