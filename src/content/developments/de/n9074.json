  "metaTitle": "4-Bed Luxury Villa Benissa €2.45M | Costa Blanca",
  "metaDescription": "Exklusiv 4-bedroom villa in Benissa, Costa Blanca. 436m² premium specification. €2.45M. Prestigious location, established expat community.",
  "heroIntro": "This exceptional 4-bedroom villa represents a rare opportunity to acquire a premium property in one of Costa Blanca's most prestigious locations. Situated in the exclusive enclave of Racó Del Galeno, Benissa, this 436-square-metre residence offers the sophisticated lifestyle discerning international buyers seek. Priced at €2,450,000, this villa delivers outstanding value—40% less expensive than comparable properties in leading Spanish island markets—while maintaining the highest standards of construction and design specification. The generous 1,530-square-metre plot provides the privacy and tranquility essential to luxury living, whilst remaining conveniently positioned within the established international community of Benissa. For buyers seeking an authentic Costa Blanca residence that combines exclusivity with accessibility, this property represents a distinctive investment opportunity. The area's growing appeal among affluent European buyers, combined with consistent property appreciation and strong rental demand, underscores the long-term value proposition.",
  "areaSection": "Benissa occupies a privileged position on the northern Costa Blanca, nestled between the Mediterranean Sea and the dramatic landscapes of the Marina Alta region. This charming coastal municipality blends authentic Valencian character with the cosmopolitan sophistication expected by international residents. The climate here is Mediterranean perfection—over 300 days of sunshine annually, mild winters averaging 12°C, and warm summers tempered by sea breezes. The town's strategic location offers the best of both worlds: genuine Spanish coastal charm combined with world-class infrastructure and international amenities. Benissa's elevated position provides natural protection and superior panoramic vistas across the Mediterranean, distinguishing it from lower-lying coastal developments. The municipality has carefully balanced development with environmental preservation, maintaining the architectural integrity that characterises the region whilst accommodating modern living standards.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Benissa revolves around the rhythm of Mediterranean living enhanced by first-world amenities. The established international community—predominantly British, German, and Scandinavian residents—has created a welcoming environment where English is widely spoken and understood. The weekly markets offer both local produce and international staples, with Mercadona and Lidl providing everyday shopping convenience. Fine dining experiences range from beachfront restaurants serving fresh Mediterranean cuisine to intimate tapas bars in the old town. Healthcare is comprehensive, with English-speaking doctors readily available and major medical facilities within 30 minutes. Multiple Blue Flag beaches lie within 20 minutes' drive, offering safe swimming and water sports. For golf enthusiasts, several championship courses are nearby.

  "investmentSection": "This property represents a compelling investment within a market demonstrating consistent strength. Costa Blanca property values have appreciated 8% year-on-year, outperforming broader Spanish real estate trends. The villa's €5,619 per square metre pricing significantly undercuts comparable properties in Mallorca and Ibiza, whilst offering superior rental potential. Benissa commands strong holiday rental demand, with comparable properties achieving €800 per week during peak season—generating annual rental income potential exceeding €30,000 for selective letting. The municipality's growing appeal among affluent European buyers, combined with its limited inventory of premium villas, suggests continued price appreciation. Unlike coastal overdevelopment in competing areas, Benissa's restricted building permissions preserve scarcity value. For buyers considering eventual sale, the property's location, specifications, and market positioning provide confidence in future liquidity and capital preservation.",
  "conclusion": "This exceptional villa in Benissa represents a distinctive opportunity to acquire a premium Mediterranean property at exceptional value compared to competing island markets. The combination of proven investment appreciation, strong rental potential, comprehensive international amenities, and authentic Spanish character creates compelling appeal for discerning international buyers. The property's position within an established expatriate community, proximity to world-class beaches and golf courses, and straightforward legal framework for foreign ownership eliminate complications often associated with Mediterranean real estate acquisition.
