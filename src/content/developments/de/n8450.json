  "heroIntro": "Discover modern apartment living in the beating heart of Torrevieja, where contemporary design meets Mediterranean convenience. This thoughtfully designed 1-bedroom apartment represents a rare opportunity to own property in one of Costa Blanca's most dynamic neighborhoods, just steps from the city's best attractions. Centro Torrevieja pulses with life—authentic Spanish culture blends with international influences, creating a neighborhood that appeals to both permanent residents and savvy investors seeking rental returns.\n\nThis new build development exemplifies the transformation happening in Torrevieja's central district. Rather than retreating to a resort enclave, you're investing in an established community with genuine soul. Walking to supermarkets, pharmacies, and restaurants takes minutes, not car journeys. The location positions you 300 meters from essential services while remaining close enough to coastal attractions to make beach days effortless. For those tired of isolated developments, this represents a refreshingly integrated approach to Costa Blanca living.\n\nThe property itself maximizes efficiency with smart design across its 33 square meters. Every inch serves a purpose, from the modern kitchen layout to the well-appointed bathroom and comfortable bedroom.

  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's property market presents compelling opportunities for investors seeking rental income without resort-development risks. The Centro neighborhood specifically attracts diverse tenant profiles—young professionals working in hospitality and services, older expatriates seeking walkable neighborhoods, and tourism-driven short-term rentals during peak seasons. Unlike seasonal-only markets, Centro Torrevieja maintains consistent demand year-round due to its integrated community and essential services.\n\nSmaller apartments like this 1-bedroom unit historically demonstrate strong rental yields in Torrevieja's center. Tourist rental platforms consistently show high occupancy rates for centrally-located properties, while the neighborhood's permanent resident population provides baseline long-term rental demand. Property appreciation follows broader Costa Blanca trends, with established neighborhoods like Centro experiencing gradual value increases as infrastructure improves and the area continues its modernization.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can I rent this apartment profitably?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Centro location commands premium nightly rates for tourist rentals (€40-70 per night depending on season). Annual occupancy rates of 60-75% are typical for well-managed central apartments. Long-term rentals to residents average €500-650 monthly. Professional property management companies in Torrevieja handle bookings and maintenance for 20-30% commission."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are utility costs for a 33m² apartment?",
      "answer": "Monthly utilities typically range €80-120 depending on season and usage. Winter heating needs are minimal in Torrevieja's Mediterranean climate. Electricity remains reasonable compared to northern European countries. Water costs stay low due to the region's water management infrastructure. Many owners report annual utility costs of €1,000-1,400 for comfortable living."
    },
    {
      "question": "How close is this to the beach really?",
      "answer": "The Playa del Cura beach is genuinely 400 meters away—about a 5-minute walk. You can walk to the beach before breakfast. Paseo Marítimo's waterfront promenade is even closer at 350 meters. During summer, beach life becomes part of your daily routine, not a planned excursion. Winter brings fewer tourists but equally pleasant beach walks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the realistic rental income potential?",

Many owners achieve higher returns with professional management and competitive pricing. Actual returns depend on property condition, host commitment, pricing strategy, and seasonal demand fluctuations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is parking available in Centro?",
      "answer": "Street parking exists throughout the neighborhood, though it can be competitive during peak hours. Development details regarding dedicated parking should be confirmed with the property agent. Many Centro residents manage without personal vehicles given the walkable neighborhood and public transportation. If parking is essential to your situation, clarify arrangements before purchase."

The area has evolved considerably, shedding outdated stereotypes while maintaining the welcoming, unpretentious atmosphere that makes Spain special.\n\nTorrevieja's center benefits from thoughtful urban planning that prioritizes walkability and accessibility. Public transportation runs frequently, making car ownership optional rather than essential. The proximity to both services and beaches creates a lifestyle where you can have morning coffee at a beachfront chiringuito and afternoon shopping in modern supermarkets, all without extensive planning.",
