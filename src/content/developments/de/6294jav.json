  "heroIntro": "Welcome to an exceptional opportunity to acquire a distinguished 4-bedroom villa in Portixol, Javea—one of the Costa Blanca's most coveted residential enclaves. Priced at €2,900,000, this exclusive property represents compelling value within Javea's luxury market, where comparable properties command €3,200/m² on average. This villa embodies the sophisticated lifestyle sought by discerning international buyers: unobstructed sea views, prime Mediterranean positioning, and proximity to world-class amenities. Javea has established itself as the preferred destination for affluent expatriates and investors seeking authentic Spanish coastal elegance without the commercial overdevelopment of neighbouring resorts. The Portixol neighbourhood epitomizes this exclusivity, offering a refined community of like-minded residents who appreciate privacy, quality architecture, and the authentic charm of the Costa Blanca. With the region experiencing consistent 6% year-on-year appreciation, this property presents both a prestigious residence and a sound investment opportunity in one of Spain's most stable property markets.",
  "areaSection": "Javea, officially Xàbia, is a picturesque coastal municipality on the northern Costa Blanca, characterized by dramatic limestone cliffs, secluded coves, and a Mediterranean climate of 300+ annual sunshine days. Located 100km northeast of Alicante, the town has evolved from a fishing village into an exclusive residential destination while maintaining its authentic Spanish character. The geography is distinctive: three distinct peninsulas create natural harbours and multiple beaches ranging from sandy stretches to intimate pebbly coves. The surrounding Sierra de Bernia mountains provide a dramatic backdrop and mitigate summer heat. Javea's elevation and coastal position create superior weather compared to inland Costa Blanca areas, with cooler summers and milder winters. The region benefits from excellent infrastructure—modern roads, reliable utilities, and efficient healthcare—while preserving natural beauty and avoiding the mass-tourism congestion of larger resorts. This balance has made Javea the preferred choice for wealthy Europeans seeking permanent residence or holiday homes.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Javea centers on unhurried Mediterranean rhythms combined with sophisticated international amenities. The established British, German, and Dutch expatriate communities have created a cosmopolitan environment where English is widely spoken and international standards are met across healthcare, education, and services. Morning rituals might include coffee at waterfront cafés overlooking the harbour, where local fishing boats operate alongside private yachts. The weekly markets deliver fresh Mediterranean produce, seafood, and regional specialities, while international supermarkets cater to specific dietary preferences. Lunch often extends through afternoon siesta hours, allowing residents to appreciate the Spanish lifestyle without sacrificing convenience. Healthcare access is exemplary: multiple private clinics employ English-speaking specialists, and Hospital de Dénia provides comprehensive services just 15 minutes away. Cultural life is vibrant—galleries, restaurants serving Michelin-standard cuisine, and seasonal festivals celebrate both Spanish traditions and international events. The sailing community is particularly active, with numerous yacht clubs and water sports facilities. Evening paseos along the seafront combine exercise with social interaction, while restaurants range from casual beachfront chiringuitos to fine-dining establishments. This lifestyle attracts professionals, retirees, and entrepreneurs seeking quality living without compromising international standards.",
