Rainfall concentrates in spring and autumn, while summer months remain dry. This consistent weather supports year-round vacation rental demand and excellent guest satisfaction ratings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Alhama De Murcia priced lower than coastal Costa Blanca properties?",
      "answer": "Alhama De Murcia trades at 40% discounts to coastal equivalents due to location inland (50km from Mediterranean), developed later than established beach towns, and smaller international profile compared to Benidorm, Torrevieja, or Malaga regions. However, these discounts represent value rather than lower quality—the property offers modern specifications with superior yields precisely because of favorable pricing."
