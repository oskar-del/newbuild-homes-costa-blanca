Positioned between the coastal tourist hotspots and inland agricultural areas, Jacarilla offers the perfect balance—close enough to beaches and amenities for holiday let demand, yet inland enough to maintain affordability. The area experiences a Mediterranean climate with 300+ sunny days annually, mild winters, and warm summers ideal for year-round rentals. The pueblo's strategic location within a 20-minute radius of multiple Blue Flag beaches, championship golf courses, and shopping centers makes it increasingly popular with international property investors. Local infrastructure continues improving, with modern medical facilities, supermarkets, and transportation links strengthening the area's appeal to both residents and renters.

Jacarilla's property values have grown 8% year-on-year, with projections suggesting continued upward momentum as international awareness of the area increases. The weekly rental rate of €800 translates to approximately €3,200 monthly assuming 40% occupancy—conservative given current coastal demand.

After accounting for maintenance, utilities, and management (typically 20-25% of gross), you're looking at net yields of 18-19%—significantly superior to traditional investment vehicles. The property's low acquisition cost means positive cash flow is achievable from day one, with capital appreciation providing long-term wealth building.
