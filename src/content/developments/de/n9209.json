  "metaDescription": "Exklusiv 3-bed villa in Roda Golf, San Javier. Premium specification at €5,707/m² - 40% less than Spanish islands. 140m² built on 300m² plot.",
  "heroIntro": "This exceptional 3-bedroom villa represents a rare opportunity for discerning buyers seeking premium specification without the inflated pricing of island markets. Located in the prestigious Roda Golf community of San Javier, this €799,000 property offers sophisticated living at €5,707 per square metre—approximately 40% less than comparable villas in Mallorca and Ibiza, yet maintaining the same calibre of construction and finishes. The villa's 140 square metres of carefully designed living space sit on a generous 300 square metre plot, providing the privacy and exclusivity that distinguishes truly premium Costa Blanca properties. San Javier has emerged as the discerning choice for international buyers seeking genuine value without compromise on lifestyle quality. This is not a mass-market development; it is a carefully curated residential enclave attracting sophisticated European professionals, successful entrepreneurs, and investors who understand the value proposition of the Costa Blanca market.",
  "areaSection": "San Javier occupies a unique position within the Murcia region, positioned between the Mediterranean coast and the inland agricultural heartland that defines southeast Spain. The town benefits from a distinctly Mediterranean microclimate, with 320+ days of sunshine annually and mild winters that rarely dip below 10°C. San Javier's geography provides natural protection from extreme weather while maintaining the coastal proximity that attracts international residents. The area has undergone significant infrastructure development in recent years, with modern utilities, high-speed internet accessibility, and well-maintained road networks connecting residents to both coastal beaches and inland attractions. The elevation and topography of San Javier mean properties here command superior views compared to flat coastal towns, while the established community infrastructure—shops, restaurants, healthcare facilities—eliminates the isolation sometimes associated with resort developments. The town sits approximately 45 minutes from Alicante International Airport, making it accessible yet removed from tourist congestion.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in San Javier offers the sophisticated balance that attracts successful international residents: authentic Spanish community character combined with comprehensive services for English-speaking expatriates. The established expat community—particularly strong in the Roda Golf area—means residents enjoy a genuine international environment without losing connection to local culture. Daily life revolves around unhurried Mediterranean rhythms: morning coffees at local cafés, afternoon beach visits to multiple Blue Flag beaches within 20 minutes' drive, and evening dining at restaurants ranging from traditional Spanish establishments to international cuisines. The healthcare infrastructure is exceptional, with a regional hospital 30 minutes away and private clinics offering English-speaking medical professionals. Shopping is convenient through supermarket chains (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum) and vibrant weekly markets offering fresh produce. For golf enthusiasts, championship courses are literally minutes away. The expat community is mature and established, meaning newcomers find seamless integration into networks of like-minded professionals and retirees. Transportation is manageable; while a car is recommended for flexibility, reliable bus connections serve the area.",
  "investmentSection": "San Javier has experienced consistent property appreciation of 8% year-on-year, outpacing many established Costa Blanca locations while remaining more affordable than northern alternatives. This villa, priced at €5,707 per square metre, offers significant capital appreciation potential as the area continues to attract international buyers. The rental market supports typical weekly rates of €800 for quality 3-bedroom properties, indicating strong income potential for buy-to-let investors. Unlike speculative developments in oversaturated markets, San Javier attracts serious buyers seeking primary residences and long-term investments rather than short-term flippers. The combination of rental income potential, capital appreciation trajectory, and currency diversification benefits (for non-Euro buyers) makes this property particularly attractive to sophisticated investors. The 40% discount compared to island markets suggests significant upside potential as San Javier's reputation continues to grow among international property professionals.",

The combination of superior specification, established community, investment appreciation potential, and genuine lifestyle benefits makes this property particularly attractive to sophisticated international buyers.
