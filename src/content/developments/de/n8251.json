    },
    {
      "question": "Können Ausländer Immobilien in Spanien kaufen?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign nationals have the same property ownership rights as Spanish citizens. Most international buyers require an NIE (Spanish tax identification number) and a Spanish bank account, but no visa or residency is required for property purchase. Our recommended legal partners handle all documentation, making the process straightforward even for first-time buyers unfamiliar with Spanish procedures."
    },
    {
      "question": "Welche Kosten fallen beim Immobilienkauf in Spanien an?",

Annual costs include property tax (IBI, typically 0.4-0.5% of property value), community fees (if applicable), and if renting, annual rental declaration filing."

    },
    {
      "question": "Brauche ich ein Visum, um Immobilien in Spanien zu kaufen?",
      "answer": "No, property purchase does not require a visa. However, obtaining an NIE (Spanish tax number) and meeting anti-money-laundering documentation requirements are mandatory.

Wealth tax applies if your total Spanish assets exceed €600,000. Capital gains tax applies on sale (19-23% depending on holding period). Non-residents pay higher tax on rental income (19-45% depending on annual rental revenue). Proper tax planning through a Spanish accountant minimizes obligations legally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wie ist das Wetter an der Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Exceptional—over 300 days of annual sunshine with average temperatures of 20°C in winter and 28°C in summer.

Sea temperatures range from 14°C (January) to 26°C (September), suitable for swimming March through November. This climate is why international retirees and holiday home buyers consistently choose Costa Blanca."
    },
    {
      "question": "Ist die Costa Blanca gut für Rentner?",
      "answer": "Extremely. Denia attracts retirees from across Northern Europe due to superior climate, lower cost of living (30-40% below UK expenses), excellent healthcare with English-speaking doctors, established expat communities eliminating isolation, and abundance of cultural activities, beaches, and outdoor pursuits. Non-lucrative resident visas welcome retirees. Many successfully retire on €1,500-€2,000 monthly, enjoying quality of life significantly above home countries."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kann ich als Ausländer eine Hypothek in Spanien bekommen?",
      "answer": "Yes, major Spanish banks (BBVA, CaixaBank, Santander) offer mortgages to foreign property buyers. Typical requirements include: NIE number, proof of income (employment letter or pension documentation), bank statements (3-6 months), and property appraisal. Loan-to-value typically maxes at 60-75%. Interest rates are competitive (2.5-4% current range). Many UK buyers use Spanish mortgages for better rates than UK cross-border lending, though some prefer UK mortgages despite slightly higher rates."
