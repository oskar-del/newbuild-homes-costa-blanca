      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys Mediterranean climate with 300+ days of sunshine annually, average temperatures of 18°C (winter) and 28°C (summer), and minimal rainfall.

Annual occupancy averaging 30-40 weeks produces gross rental income of €30,000-€41,000, depending on management and marketing. After property management, maintenance, and utilities (typically 25-30% of gross revenue), net yields range from 18-22% for direct operators or 12-15% for delegated management."
    },
    {
      "question": "Brauche ich ein Visum, um Immobilien in Spanien zu kaufen?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically to purchase Spanish property—nationality or residency status doesn't restrict property ownership. However, if you plan to spend more than 90 days within any 180-day period, visa requirements depend on your citizenship. UK, EU, and many other nationalities don't require visas for tourism. Those seeking residency (for permanent relocation or extended stays) should investigate specific visa programs available through Spanish immigration authorities."
