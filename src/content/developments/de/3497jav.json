  "areaSection": "Javea, perched on the northern Costa Blanca, is a picturesque coastal town renowned for its dramatic cliffs, pristine beaches, and authentic Mediterranean character. Located in Alicante province, this charming destination combines Old World Spanish charm with modern amenities that cater to an international audience. The town's geography is distinctive—framed by the Montgo mountain and blessed with a coastline featuring both sandy beaches and hidden coves. The climate is exceptional year-round, with over 320 days of sunshine annually, mild winters, and warm summers tempered by sea breezes. Javea's popularity stems from its perfect balance: it's developed enough to offer quality infrastructure and services, yet maintains the relaxed, authentic atmosphere that mass-market resorts have lost. The surrounding countryside features Mediterranean vegetation, charming villages, and easy access to both the coast and inland attractions.",

The expat community—particularly British, German, and Dutch residents—has created a welcoming atmosphere where English is widely spoken, yet Spanish culture remains authentic and accessible. Weekly markets overflow with fresh local produce, supermarkets stock international favorites, and the British Corner Shop caters to homesick visitors. Healthcare is excellent with English-speaking doctors readily available, Dénia's modern hospital just 15 minutes away, and numerous private clinics offering quality care. The social calendar is vibrant: golf clubs, beach clubs, cultural events, and a thriving restaurant scene ensure there's always something to do.
