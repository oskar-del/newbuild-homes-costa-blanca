The town's bohemian atmosphere, local fish restaurants, and weekend markets create an enviable rhythm of life. Real estate here represents genuine value; the €2,200/m² average is significantly lower than nearby coastal areas, yet the town itself offers all the amenities and infrastructure of premium destinations. The property market has appreciated 8% year-on-year, reflecting both local confidence and growing international interest.",
