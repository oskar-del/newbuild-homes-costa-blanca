This pueblo-style town maintains authentic Spanish character while embracing the modern conveniences expected by international residents. The location sits at the crossroads of accessibility—just 40 kilometers from Alicante Airport, yet far enough removed to escape the hustle of overdeveloped coastal strips.

The surrounding landscape transitions from beaches to agricultural regions, creating visual variety and genuine community beyond tourist zones. San Fulgencio has evolved into a genuine residential community with solid infrastructure, making it increasingly popular with buyers seeking authentic Spain rather than international resort bubbles.",

Your days might begin at a local café with café con leche and churros, continue with a beach morning at nearby Playa Paraiso or Playa del Torres, and finish with dinner at one of the excellent seafood restaurants dotting the region. The weekly markets showcase Mediterranean produce, fresh fish, and local artisanal products. Shopping centers in nearby Torrevieja provide international brands and supermarket chains alongside traditional Spanish markets. Healthcare is excellent—English-speaking doctors, private clinics, and a regional hospital all within 30 minutes.
