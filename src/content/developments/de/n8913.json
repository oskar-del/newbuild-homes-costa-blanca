This price includes modern finishes, quality construction, and prime beachside location."
    },
    {
      "question": "Können Ausländer Immobilien in Spanien kaufen?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Non-EU and EU citizens have equal rights to purchase Spanish property without residency requirements. British, American, Australian, and other international buyers routinely purchase throughout the Costa Blanca. The process requires an NIE number (Spanish tax identification), property lawyer representation, and standard conveyancing. Most transactions complete within 8-12 weeks. Legal costs average 6-8% of purchase price (including lawyer, notary, and registration fees)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wie hoch sind die Lebenshaltungskosten an der Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Significantly lower than UK and northern Europe. Groceries cost 20-30% less, restaurant meals €8-15 for quality dining, utilities €60-100 monthly, and fuel €1.20-1.40 per liter. Annual healthcare (private insurance) costs €40-60 monthly. Many retirees report living comfortably on €1,500-2,000 monthly. Pilar de La Horadada offers excellent value: smaller than resort towns (lower prices) yet with superior infrastructure compared to rural areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kann ich als Ausländer eine Hypothek in Spanien bekommen?",
      "answer": "Yes. Spanish banks offer mortgages to non-resident foreign buyers at 60-80% LTV (loan-to-value ratio). Interest rates currently range 3.5-4.5%. Required documentation includes proof of income (3-6 months bank statements), identification, and property appraisal. Processing takes 4-6 weeks. Alternative: UK mortgages occasionally cover Spanish property purchases, sometimes at superior rates. Consult mortgage brokers specializing in Spanish property for best options."
    },
    {
      "question": "Ist die Costa Blanca ein guter Ort zum Immobilienkauf?",
      "answer": "Excellent choice for holiday buyers and investors. The region experiences 8% annual appreciation, consistent rental demand (€800+ weekly for quality properties), established international infrastructure, and year-round sunshine. Unlike oversaturated resort areas, Pilar de La Horadada balances accessibility with authentic Spanish character. The combination of beach living, healthcare, education, and cost-efficiency makes it ideal for second homes and retirement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Welche Kosten fallen beim Immobilienkauf in Spanien an?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, budget 6-8% for legal/administrative costs: lawyer fees (1.5-2%), notary (0.5-1%), property registration (0.5-1%), and transfer tax (6-7% depending on region). Mortgage arrangement typically adds another 1%. Die jährlichen Grundsteuern (IBI) average 0.4-0.6% of property value. These costs are standard and non-negotiable; they're significantly lower than UK conveyancing costs (10-12%)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wie ist das Wetter an der Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Exceptional year-round. Summers average 25-30°C with low rainfall; winters remain mild at 10-15°C. The region experiences 320 days of sunshine annually—more than anywhere in mainland Spain. Spring and autumn offer perfect 18-22°C temperatures ideal for beach and outdoor activities. Rainfall concentrates in autumn/winter, averaging 380mm annually (comparable to southern UK). Hurricane risk is virtually non-existent. Most residents report weather as a primary reason for purchasing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wie weit ist die Costa Blanca von Deutschland entfernt?",
      "answer": "Alicante Airport is 55 minutes from Pilar de La Horadada with direct flights to London, Manchester, Birmingham, and other UK airports (2-2.5 hours flight time). Budget airlines offer frequent connections at €40-100 return fares. Ferry options exist (Portsmouth-Cherbourg-Mediterranean route, 36+ hours). Most holiday buyers visit monthly via direct flights. The distance remains close enough for extended UK business/family visits while maintaining Mediterranean living."
    },
    {
      "question": "Ist die Costa Blanca gut für Rentner?",
      "answer": "Ideal for retirees. Cost of living is 30-40% lower than UK, healthcare is exceptional with English-speaking doctors, and sunshine creates active lifestyles. The established expat community (estimated 300,000+ in the region) provides social infrastructure. Pensions stretch further, property provides rental income, and the climate reduces healthcare expenses. Tax implications exist: consult advisors regarding UK pensions and Spanish taxation. Many UK retirees successfully transition within 3-6 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can I earn renting this property?",
      "answer": "€800+ per week during peak season (June-September) is realistic for this property. Conservative annual estimates: 50% occupancy generates €20,000-25,000; 60-70% occupancy (achievable with professional management) generates €28,000-35,000. Property management companies charge 20-30% commission but handle bookings, cleaning, and guest communication. Many owners net €15,000-20,000 annually after expenses (cleaning, utilities, maintenance, manager fees). This substantially offsets ownership costs."
