  "areaSection": "Guardamar del Segura is a charming coastal town of approximately 15,000 residents located 35km south of Alicante city. Positioned at the mouth of the Segura River delta, the town combines authentic Spanish heritage with modern European conveniences. The climate is Mediterranean with 320+ days of annual sunshine, mild winters (rarely below 10°C), and warm, dry summers. Unlike busier Costa Blanca resorts, Guardamar maintains a relaxed, genuine atmosphere while offering sophisticated amenities. The town's beaches are among Spain's finest, backed by protected dunes and awarded Blue Flag status for cleanliness and safety. The property market here has appreciated consistently at 7% year-on-year, reflecting both local confidence and international recognition of the area's enduring appeal.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Guardamar del Segura revolves around a slower, more intentional pace that many retirees actively seek. Mornings might begin with a paseo (leisurely walk) along the waterfront promenade, followed by coffee at a local café where you'll encounter a genuine mix of Spanish residents and fellow expatriates. Wednesday's traditional market brings fresh produce, local crafts, and authentic community atmosphere. Healthcare is excellent with Hospital de Torrevieja just 15 minutes away and multiple private clinics offering English-speaking medical professionals. Supermarkets including Mercadona, Consum, and Lidl provide familiar shopping experiences, while local restaurants serve fresh seafood and regional specialties. The expat community here feels more integrated and less insular than in larger resort towns, fostering genuine friendships across cultures. Beaches invite regular swimming, while nearby golf courses at La Marquesa and La Finca provide recreation just 10-15 minutes away.",

Guardamar del Segura's property values have grown 7% year-on-year, driven by increased recognition from international buyers seeking authentic Costa Blanca living.
