Spanning 109 square metres, the property is thoughtfully designed with an open-plan layout that maximizes natural light and creates an inviting living space ideal for families, couples, or investors seeking exposure to Torrevieja's thriving property market.\n\nWhat truly sets this property apart is its exceptional location.

  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's rental market remains robust for property investors. The combination of beach proximity, year-round mild climate, and established tourist infrastructure creates consistent demand for short-term holiday rentals. This particular property's centro location is particularly attractive for investors seeking high occupancy rates—many visitors prefer staying in town rather than purpose-built resort areas, appreciating the authentic neighbourhood feel and restaurant-rich environment.\n\nFor long-term rental investment, the centro neighbourhood appeals to expats and professionals relocating to the Costa Blanca. Demand for well-located apartments from people seeking established communities rather than isolated developments is consistently strong. The property's 3-bedroom layout suits families or groups of friends sharing, typically achieving higher monthly rates than smaller units. With Torrevieja's stable property prices compared to western Costa Blanca areas, investor entry costs remain accessible while rental returns remain competitive.",
