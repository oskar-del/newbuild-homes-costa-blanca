  "metaDescription": "Modern 2-bedroom bungalow in Altos del Sol, Torrevieja. New development just 1km from the coast. Energy-efficient living near beaches and marinas.",
  "heroIntro": "Welcome to Altos del Sol, Torrevieja's contemporary residential enclave where modern architecture meets coastal convenience. Reference N8465 presents a thoughtfully designed 2-bedroom bungalow in this increasingly popular development, positioned just 1 kilometer from Torrevieja's pristine Mediterranean shoreline. This 79m² property represents new construction quality at a location that balances accessibility to beaches with proximity to the town's vibrant commercial and leisure offerings.\n\nTorrevieja has evolved significantly over the past decade, transforming from a traditional fishing village into a dynamic coastal destination. The town now hosts over 100,000 residents and attracts visitors year-round, drawn by its 42 kilometers of beaches, natural salt lagoons, and modern infrastructure. Altos del Sol specifically occupies a strategic position within this landscape—close enough to reach the beach on foot, yet positioned in a quieter residential zone that prioritizes family living and long-term community development.\n\nThis bungalow exemplifies the modern approach to Costa Blanca living. With 2 generous bedrooms, 2 full bathrooms, and efficient 79m² layout, the property offers the practical features today's buyers demand: proper space allocation, contemporary finishes, and a location that doesn't sacrifice lifestyle for convenience.",
  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's rental market has matured significantly, with diverse tenant demographics supporting stable occupancy rates. The town attracts approximately 1.2 million overnight stays annually across all accommodation types, with demand particularly strong during spring and autumn shoulder seasons when temperatures remain ideal. Properties near beaches and in planned communities like Altos del Sol achieve consistent rental returns, typically 5-7% annually, particularly when marketed to families seeking month-long stays or seasonal European visitors.\n\nBeyond short-term rental potential, Torrevieja itself continues appreciating as infrastructure improves and the city reinforces its identity as a cultural and recreational center. Recent municipal investments in the marina district, cultural venues, and beach restoration have attracted younger families alongside traditional retirees, creating balanced long-term demand. The 1-kilometer proximity to beaches positions this property favorably for both rental conversion and personal use, making it suitable for investors planning eventual owner-occupancy.",

      "question": "What's the rental potential for a 2-bedroom property in this area?",

      "answer": "The neighborhood achieves good walkability for essential amenities. Markets, restaurants, and cafes are accessible within 1.5-2.5 kilometers.

    },
    {
      "question": "What additional costs should buyers anticipate beyond purchase price?",

These costs are standard for Spanish residential property and relatively predictable for budgeting purposes."
