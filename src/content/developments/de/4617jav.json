  "areaSection": "Javea, nestled on the Costa Blanca's northeastern coast, occupies a privileged position between the towns of Benidorm and Denia. The municipality embraces three distinct geographical areas—Arenal with its expansive sandy beaches, the charming Old Town with its fishing heritage, and the coastal properties commanding dramatic Mediterranean vistas. The region experiences over 300 days of annual sunshine, creating an idyllic Mediterranean climate with mild winters and warm, sun-drenched summers. This microclimate, coupled with the Montgó mountain backdrop, creates a natural amphitheater of exceptional beauty. Javea has developed a reputation as the thinking person's Costa Blanca destination—sophisticated without pretension, established without feeling dated. The town maintains authentic Spanish character while accommodating an international community of professionals, entrepreneurs, and retirees who have chosen Javea specifically for its combination of natural beauty, stable infrastructure, and genuine quality of life.",

The substantial international community—particularly British, German, and Dutch residents—has established sophisticated dining, cultural, and social infrastructure while preserving authentic Spanish character.

  "investmentSection": "Javea's property market demonstrates consistent appreciation, with year-on-year growth of approximately 6%, positioning this villa favorably for capital growth. The €1,690,000 price point represents competitive valuation compared to Javea's €3,200 per square meter average and sits approximately 30% below comparable Mallorca properties, offering significant value arbitrage for international buyers.

Javea attracts affluent retirees, remote workers, and investors seeking Mediterranean exposure without excessive tourism pressures. The town's English-speaking infrastructure, healthcare facilities, and international community have created sustainable demand from Northern European buyers. Long-term appreciation is supported by limited development potential on this coastal stretch, environmental protections, and Javea's established reputation as a permanent residence destination rather than transient resort.",

The combination of sea views, prestigious location, established international community infrastructure, and competitive €1,690,000 pricing creates a rare convergence of lifestyle and investment merit.
