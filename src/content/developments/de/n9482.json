    },
    {
      "question": "Welche Kosten fallen beim Immobilienkauf in Spanien an?",

Healthcare costs are reasonable, with private consultations €50-100.

    },
    {
      "question": "Wie ist das Wetter an der Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Exceptional. Avileses enjoys Mediterranean climate with 300+ days of annual sunshine, mild winters (average 12-14°C), and warm summers (28-32°C). Rainfall is minimal, concentrated in autumn and spring.

This predictable, sunny climate is why Costa Blanca attracts international residents globally and supports thriving outdoor lifestyle."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wie weit ist die Costa Blanca von Deutschland entfernt?",
      "answer": "Very accessible. Alicante Airport, 90 minutes from Avileses, offers direct flights to London and major UK airports with multiple daily services.

Properties comparable to this 3-bedroom town house typically command €800+ per week during peak summer months (June-August) and €400-600 during shoulder seasons. Conservative annual rental income estimates suggest €20,000-28,000, representing 20-25% returns on property value. Many owners employ management companies (10-15% commission) to handle bookings and maintenance, making passive income genuinely passive. Rental demand remains robust with growing tourism to Costa Blanca."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is this property 40% cheaper than Spanish island properties?",
      "answer": "Avileses is a genuine Mediterranean town rather than a premium resort island destination. Properties on Mallorca, Ibiza, and Menorca command island premiums—20-40% higher prices for identical specifications due to perceived exclusivity and limited land availability. Avileses offers identical sunshine, beaches, and lifestyle at mainland prices. This represents intelligent value—you're purchasing the same Mediterranean experience without paying for island marketing and scarcity premiums. Smart buyers recognize this as exceptional opportunity."
