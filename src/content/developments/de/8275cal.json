Calpe's unique position between mountain and sea creates microclimates that enhance both beauty and livability. The town has evolved from a fishing village into a sophisticated coastal destination while maintaining its authentic Spanish character. The natural harbor and protected beaches have historically attracted affluent residents seeking the combination of natural beauty, cultural heritage, and modern amenities that characterize the most desirable Mediterranean locations.",
