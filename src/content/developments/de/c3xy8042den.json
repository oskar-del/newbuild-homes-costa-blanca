The climate is Mediterranean bliss year-round, with 300+ days of sunshine, mild winters averaging 12°C, and warm summers rarely exceeding 28°C. Denia's strategic location just 90 minutes from Valencia and Alicante airports, combined with ferry connections to Ibiza and Mallorca, makes it uniquely accessible.
