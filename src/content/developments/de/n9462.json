Located between Guardamar del Segura and Pilar de la Horadada, Benijofar benefits from exceptional sunshine throughout the year—over 300 days annually. The pueblo sits slightly inland, offering the perfect balance: close enough to beaches for quick getaways, far enough to maintain village tranquility and avoid mass tourism. The area's geography features gentle terrain ideal for families and retirees. Local agriculture still shapes the landscape, with citrus groves and date palms dotting the countryside. The elevation provides natural cooling breezes while maintaining warm Mediterranean temperatures. Benijofar has experienced steady growth in recent years, with modern infrastructure complementing traditional architecture. The combination of coastal proximity, authentic Spanish culture, and year-round sunshine creates an irresistible appeal for holiday home buyers.",
