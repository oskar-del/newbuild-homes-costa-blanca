  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's tourism infrastructure makes this property attractive for short-term rental returns. The town welcomes approximately 3 million visitors annually, with peak seasons from May through September and secondary peaks during Easter and winter holidays. The 2-bedroom configuration appeals to families and small groups, a segment that commands premium nightly rates during season. Properties in central locations near beaches consistently perform well in the rental market, with many owners achieving 5-8% gross yields. Beyond tourism, the town has a growing permanent expatriate community seeking long-term rentals, providing stable off-season income. The new build status means lower maintenance costs initially and the ability to market the property with contemporary standards and modern amenities that justify competitive pricing.",
