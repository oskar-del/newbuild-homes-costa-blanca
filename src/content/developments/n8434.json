  "heroIntro": "Welcome to modern coastal living in Torrevieja. This expertly designed 2-bedroom penthouse offers the perfect blend of contemporary comfort and beachside convenience, situated just 250 meters from the pristine El Cura Beach. With 74m² of thoughtfully laid-out living space, this property represents a rare opportunity to own a newly constructed home in one of the Costa Blanca's most sought-after beach communities.\n\nThe penthouse format provides distinct advantages over standard apartments. The private solarium offers an exclusive outdoor retreat where you can enjoy Mediterranean sunshine, morning coffee, or evening drinks with unobstructed views.

    "intro": "Playa de El Cura sits on Torrevieja's northern coastline, offering residents direct access to one of the most beautiful and well-maintained beaches in the region. The neighborhood combines genuine local character with convenient access to essential services, restaurants, and entertainment.

The promenade stretches for several kilometers, perfect for evening paseos (walks), cycling, or jogging. Behind the beach, a network of streets offers local shops, pharmacies, and small restaurants that serve the actual community rather than just tourists.",

With property management services readily available in Torrevieja, hands-off ownership is entirely practical for international investors.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is 250 meters from the beach really walkable for daily life?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. 250 meters is approximately a 3-minute flat walk along the promenade. For comparison, many people walk 500+ meters to work or transit daily. The proximity means you can easily pop down for a swim during lunch, walk to beach restaurants for dinner, or enjoy the sea breezes in your living space."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes the private solarium valuable?",
      "answer": "Spanish climate allows outdoor use 300+ days yearly. The solarium provides exclusive outdoor space without yard maintenance responsibilities. For rental properties, it significantly increases appeal and justifies premium pricing compared to standard apartments. Functionally, it extends your living space by 20-30% during good weather months."
    },
    {
      "question": "How established is the El Cura Beach neighborhood?",
