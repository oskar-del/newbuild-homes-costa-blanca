  "areaSection": "Pilar de La Horadada sits on the southern Costa Blanca, positioned between the developed coastal areas and the quieter inland pueblos that Spanish locals prefer. Located in Alicante province, this town enjoys a Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually and mild winters that rarely drop below 10°C. The geography offers genuine advantages: you're close enough to cosmopolitan amenities (Alicante city is 50 minutes away), yet removed from the high-rise tourism that characterizes other Costa Blanca destinations. The nearby Segura River and surrounding agricultural lands create natural beauty without the overdevelopment seen in resort towns. This is where many Spanish families actually choose to live when they're not selling to tourists—a telling indicator of genuine quality of life.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life here revolves around genuine community and sensible pleasures. You'll shop at modern supermarkets like Mercadona and Lidl, but also enjoy weekly local markets where Spanish vendors sell seasonal produce and you'll hear English spoken as naturally as Spanish. The established expat community—particularly British, German, and Scandinavian residents—means you'll never feel isolated, yet the town maintains its authentic Spanish character. Healthcare is straightforward: a regional hospital lies within 30 minutes, with English-speaking doctors and private clinics available for those preferring them. Mornings might involve a coffee at a local café where neighbors gather; afternoons could mean a drive to one of the Blue Flag beaches (20 minutes away) or a round at a nearby championship golf course. Evenings feature fresh seafood at modest prices, cultural events at the town center, or simply time on your own terrace enjoying the Mediterranean breeze. This is relaxed living without sacrifice.",
