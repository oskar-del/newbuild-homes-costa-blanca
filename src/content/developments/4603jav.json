The town benefits from a unique microclimate, sheltered by the Montgó mountain, resulting in milder winters and reliably warm summers. With over 300 sunshine hours annually, Javea transforms into a Mediterranean canvas of blue waters, whitewashed buildings, and pine-covered hillsides. The historic old town retains authentic charm with narrow cobbled streets and traditional architecture, while modern amenities seamlessly blend with coastal village character.
