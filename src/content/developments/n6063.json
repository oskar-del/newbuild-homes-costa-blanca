  "investmentSection": "This property represents compelling investment potential in a rapidly appreciating coastal market. Gran Alacant's 8% year-on-year property appreciation significantly outpaces broader Costa Blanca averages, driven by sustained international buyer interest and limited development availability. Holiday rental potential is substantial – similar 3-bedroom properties in the area generate €800 weekly during peak season, with shoulder seasons commanding €500-700 per week. Conservative estimates suggest annual rental income of €20,000-25,000, delivering 5-6% gross yield. The property's premium specification justifies above-average pricing at €4,362/m² compared to Gran Alacant's €2,200/m² average, yet remains 40% cheaper than equivalent properties on Ibiza, Mallorca, or other Spanish islands. Whether held as a personal holiday retreat generating seasonal income or purely as a buy-and-hold appreciation play, this property offers multiple financial pathways in Europe's most stable property market.",
