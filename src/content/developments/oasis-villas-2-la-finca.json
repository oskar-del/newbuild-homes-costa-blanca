    "investmentSection": "La Finca Golf Resort represents one of the most compelling investment opportunities in Costa Blanca South. Properties within the resort have consistently demonstrated strong capital appreciation, driven by limited availability and growing international demand for golf lifestyle properties.\n\nThe rental market for golf villas in this area is particularly robust, with La Finca properties commanding premium rates throughout the extended golf season (September to June). International golf tourists, particularly from the UK, Scandinavia, and Northern Europe, actively seek quality villa accommodation with golf course access. With professional management, owners can expect attractive rental yields while enjoying personal use during their preferred times.\n\nOff-plan purchases like Oasis Villas 2 offer additional advantages: secure today's prices against market appreciation, customize finishes to your preferences, and benefit from phased payment schedules that make ownership more accessible.",
