This 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom bungalow offers the perfect base for golfers seeking championship courses without compromising on comfort or budget. Located in Algorfa's prestigious golf community, you're steps away from La Finca's pristine fairways and the region's top-rated courses including Lo Romero, La Marquesa, and Vistabella. At €349,000, this property represents exceptional value—priced at €3,635 per square meter, it's 50% less expensive than comparable coastal properties while delivering premium specifications and unbeatable golf access. The 96-square-meter layout has been thoughtfully designed with golfers in mind: spacious living areas for entertaining fellow golfers, modern kitchen facilities, and direct community access to one of Spain's finest golf destinations. With a growing +12% year-on-year market trend and strong rental potential (€900 per week typical), this represents both a lifestyle upgrade and a smart investment opportunity in the thriving Alicante property market.",
  "areaSection": "Algorfa is a charming inland village in southern Alicante, positioned perfectly between the coast and interior region. Situated just 15-20 minutes from Mediterranean beaches and surrounded by championship golf courses, it offers the ideal balance for active retirees and golf enthusiasts. The area enjoys over 300 days of sunshine annually, with mild winters and warm summers—perfect for year-round golfing. Algorfa's elevation and inland position mean lower temperatures than coastal towns, creating more comfortable conditions during peak summer. The village maintains an authentic Spanish character while welcoming a significant international community, particularly within the golf resort developments. Property prices here remain 50% below coastal alternatives, making it increasingly popular with savvy buyers seeking value without sacrificing lifestyle amenities.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Algorfa revolves around golf, relaxation, and Mediterranean leisure. Mornings start with rounds at championship courses or practice sessions at La Finca's facilities, followed by lunch at the clubhouse—the unofficial heart of the expat community where English is widely spoken. The international golf community here is well-established and welcoming, with regular tournaments, social events, and networking opportunities throughout the year. Evenings might include dinner at local Spanish restaurants in the village or nearby Rojales, shopping for fresh produce at weekly markets, or simply enjoying sunset views from your terrace. Weekend trips to Torrevieja's beaches (20 minutes) or Guardamar's quieter shores (15 minutes) are easy escapes. The pace is unhurried but never boring—golf clubs, health-conscious dining options, and a thriving expat social scene ensure plenty of engagement. Your car becomes your best friend for beach days, larger shopping trips to Torrevieja's hypermarkets, and exploring the broader Costa Blanca region.",

  "investmentSection": "Beyond lifestyle, this property offers compelling investment fundamentals. Algorfa's property market has appreciated 12% year-on-year, significantly outpacing broader Spanish averages. The rental market is particularly strong for golf-oriented properties—expect €900 per week during peak seasons and solid off-season bookings from golf tourists visiting the region's championship courses. At €3,635 per square meter versus Algorfa's €1,600 average, you're paying a premium for the golf location and community amenities, but this premium is justified by superior rental yields and demand. Compare this to coastal Torrevieja properties at €7,000+ per square meter, and the value proposition becomes clear. The growing international community, improving infrastructure, and expanding golf tourism make Algorfa increasingly attractive for both personal enjoyment and portfolio building. Many owners successfully balance personal use with rental income, generating returns that offset annual costs.",
