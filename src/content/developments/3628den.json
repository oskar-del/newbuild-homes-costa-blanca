Unlike heavily developed Costa del Sol regions, Denia retains genuine Spanish charm with working fishing harbours, authentic markets, and centuries of cultural heritage. The area benefits from the Sierra de Bernia range to its west, providing natural protection and creating exceptional sunset viewing opportunities. Its northern position on the Costa Blanca places it closer to European destinations whilst maintaining distinctly Mediterranean character.",
