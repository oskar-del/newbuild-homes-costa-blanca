  "metaTitle": "3 Bed Penthouse El Acequión Torrevieja - Beach Lifestyle",
  "metaDescription": "Luxury 3 bedroom penthouse 60m from El Acequión Beach. Modern build, private terrace, parking. Torrevieja lifestyle living.",
  "heroIntro": "This modern 3-bedroom penthouse offers the rare combination of proximity to El Acequión Beach and a well-designed contemporary home. Located just 60 meters from one of Torrevieja's most beloved beaches, this 107m² residence captures the essence of Mediterranean living without the compromise of quality or comfort. The penthouse sits within a thoughtfully planned residential complex of 23 homes, meaning you avoid the isolation of standalone properties while enjoying genuine community amenities.\n\nEl Acequión Beach is distinctive along the Costa Blanca—it's a working fishing village beach, where authentic paella restaurants operate alongside modern beach bars, and traditional boats share the waterline with swimmers. This penthouse positions you at the heart of that authentic experience. You're not in a sprawling resort; you're in a functioning coastal neighborhood with real character. The building's location on the quieter edge of Torrevieja means you'll experience the beach lifestyle without the peak season chaos of central tourist zones.\n\nThe penthouse format is increasingly rare in new Costa Blanca builds. The large private terrace transforms this from a standard apartment into a proper outdoor living space—ideal for morning coffee with sea breezes or evening entertaining. Underground parking, while seemingly practical, reflects the developer's commitment to preserving the pedestrian-friendly character of the neighborhood rather than littering streets with vehicles.",

This specific location appeals to those seeking authentic Mediterranean living rather than resort-style developments.",

  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's rental market has matured beyond peak-season tourism into year-round occupancy patterns. Properties near El Acequión attract both summer visitors and autumn-to-spring residents seeking mild Mediterranean winters. The 3-bedroom format is particularly attractive to rental investors—families and friend groups prefer spacious apartments over smaller units, justifying premium rental rates. The underground parking addresses a genuine pain point for short-term renters accustomed to Northern European standards, making this property more competitive than older buildings.\n\nBeyond tourism, Torrevieja hosts an increasing number of remote workers and early retirees who value beach proximity without resort development density. This shifts the investment profile from seasonal rental to more stable year-round occupancy. The beachfront location commands consistent demand, while the building's modest size means less risk of oversupply compared to massive resort complexes.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is El Acequión Beach suitable for year-round swimming?",
      "answer": "Yes. Mediterranean water temperatures average 18°C in winter (suitable for wetsuits) and 26°C in summer. El Acequión's fishing village character means fewer crowds than main beaches. Local residents routinely swim October through May."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes El Acequión different from Torrevieja's other beaches?",
      "answer": "El Acequión maintains its working fishing village identity with authentic paella restaurants and local fishing boats. Unlike central Torrevieja beaches developed for mass tourism, this area retains neighborhood character while offering full beach amenities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is underground parking valuable in this location?",
      "answer": "Significantly valuable. Beach areas suffer chronic parking shortages during summer. Underground parking eliminates daily frustration and protects your vehicle from salt air corrosion—extending car lifespan substantially in coastal environments."
    },
    {
      "question": "What rental income potential does a 3-bedroom penthouse offer?",
      "answer": "Three-bedroom units command 40-60% premium rental rates over 2-bedroom equivalents. Monthly winter rentals average €1,200-1,600 (versus €800-1,000 for 2-beds). Families prefer spacious units, ensuring consistent occupancy and justifying higher rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is 107m² sufficient for comfortable living with 3 bedrooms?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the long-term appreciation outlook for El Acequión properties?",
      "answer": "El Acequión benefits from Torrevieja's shift toward sustainable living destinations.
