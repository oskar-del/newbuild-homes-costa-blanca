  "investmentSection": "This penthouse presents compelling investment fundamentals supported by regional market dynamics and rental demand patterns. The Costa Blanca property market demonstrates consistent year-on-year appreciation of 7%, significantly outpacing inflation and providing capital growth potential. Rental analysis indicates typical weekly rental rates of €700 for comparable properties, suggesting annual gross rental returns of approximately €36,400, yielding 5.7% on the purchase price before expenses. The location's growing international appeal and limited premium inventory creates ongoing demand from both owner-occupiers and investment portfolios. Positioning at €7,033 per square meter compared to €1,750 average for Guardamar del Segura reflects premium specification justification rather than location premium. This valuation discount compared to Jávea creates arbitrage opportunity—discerning investors recognize equivalent quality at substantially lower capital requirement. The emerging profile of Guardamar as the sophisticate's alternative to overcrowded Costa Blanca hotspots suggests continued value appreciation as international awareness expands.",
