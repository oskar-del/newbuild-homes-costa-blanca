    },
    {
      "question": "Can foreigners buy property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Non-EU and EU citizens can purchase Spanish property without restrictions. You'll need a Spanish tax identification number (NIE), which is straightforward to obtain. Most British buyers work with English-speaking solicitors to manage the process. No residency requirement exists—you can own purely as a holiday home investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the costs of buying property in Spain?",
      "answer": "Beyond the €235,000 purchase price, expect additional costs: property transfer tax (6-10%), notary fees (€800-1,500), registry fees (€200-400), and legal fees if using a solicitor (€1,500-3,000).

      "question": "Do I need a visa to buy property in Spain?",
      "answer": "No. Property purchase doesn't require a Spanish visa. However, you'll need a NIE (Spanish tax ID) to complete the transaction. As a British citizen, you may need a visa for residency if staying beyond 90 days, but holiday home ownership requires no residency visa. Consult current Brexit immigration rules for your specific situation."
    },
    {

This is significantly lower than UK council tax. Additionally, non-resident property owners pay a wealth tax on properties valued over €600,000 (this property falls below that threshold). Rental income is taxable at standard rates if you let the property."
    },

      "answer": "Alicante Airport, 30 minutes from this Cox property, operates direct flights to London and UK regional airports multiple times daily. Flight time averages 2.5 hours.
