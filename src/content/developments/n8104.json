  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is the beach really walkable at 700 metres, or is that marketing exaggeration?",
      "answer": "700 metres represents approximately 8-10 minutes leisurely walking distance, verified against actual street layouts. Torreblanca Beach features safe pedestrian access through residential streets, making genuine daily beach visits realistic. This differs from properties claiming 'beach proximity' while requiring car transport."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes this penthouse different from regular apartments in the same development?",
      "answer": "Penthouses offer exclusive benefits: private solarium terraces (unavailable in standard units), top-floor positioning ensuring better light and views, enhanced privacy through reduced shared walls, and elevated positioning capturing Mediterranean breezes. These features justify premium pricing and command stronger rental demand."
    },
    {
      "question": "How reliable is Torrevieja's rental market for investment returns?",
      "answer": "Torrevieja hosts approximately 140,000 annual tourists plus growing permanent residents seeking winter retreats. Established rental management agencies operate throughout the city, simplifying property administration for non-resident investors. Average occupancy rates for quality beachside properties exceed 55% annually, though penthouses command premium rates during peak seasons."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are typical utility costs for a property this size in Torrevieja?",
      "answer": "Modern construction specifications mean realistic monthly utility estimates: electricity (winter heating and summer cooling) €80-120, water €20-30, and community fees €120-180 depending on amenity usage. Costs vary seasonally, with winter months higher in northern Europe-influenced residences."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the gated community safe, and what security measures exist?",
      "answer": "Gated urbanizations provide controlled access points, CCTV surveillance, and management security protocols standard throughout Costa Blanca developments. This significantly reduces property crime compared to open residential areas. Torrevieja's established infrastructure means security response times remain effective."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does property ownership work for non-EU citizens, and what are tax implications?",
      "answer": "Non-EU citizens require Spanish identification (NIE) but face no ownership restrictions. Property transfer involves standard legal procedures through Spanish solicitors. Annual property taxes (IBI) average 0.4-0.8% of cadastral value. Rental income taxation depends on residency status, requiring specialist accountant guidance for optimization."
