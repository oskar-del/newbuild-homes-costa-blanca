  "investmentSection": "This property represents compelling investment value in a rising market. Fuente Álamo has appreciated 8% year-on-year, outperforming broader Costa Blanca growth rates. At €2,846 per square meter, you're paying 30% above the local area average of €2,200/m², but this premium reflects the property's newer build status, modern specifications, and rental-ready condition. The real opportunity lies in rental income: typical holiday lets in this area command €800 per week (€3,200 monthly during peak season). A conservative 20-week rental season generates €16,000 annually—an 8% gross yield before accounting for personal use. Properties at this price point and quality level in southern Spain appreciate steadily as international demand grows. Unlike Spanish island markets where similar properties cost €4,700+/m², Fuente Álamo offers 40% better value while maintaining strong demand from British, Dutch, and German buyers seeking Mediterranean lifestyles.",

You'll need a Spanish NIE (tax identification number), complete standard conveyancing through a Spanish notary, and pay typical transfer taxes (6-10%).
