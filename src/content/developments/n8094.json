  "areaSection": "Algorfa is a charming inland village in the Vega Baja region of Alicante Province, positioned strategically between the Costa Blanca beaches and the rolling interior landscapes. This whitewashed pueblo maintains authentic Spanish character while hosting a substantial international community drawn by proximity to multiple championship golf courses. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and mild winters – perfect for year-round golfing. Algorfa sits at approximately 60 metres elevation, offering cleaner air than coastal towns and remarkable value for property investment. The village has evolved thoughtfully around golf tourism, with La Finca Golf anchoring the community, yet it retains local charm with family-run restaurants, weekly markets, and genuine Spanish hospitality. Located just 45 minutes from Alicante International Airport and 15 minutes from beautiful Guardamar beaches, Algorfa occupies an enviable middle ground – close enough to amenities and transport, far enough inland to avoid coastal development pressures and price premiums.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Algorfa revolves around the golf calendar and an active expatriate community united by shared passions. Morning rounds at La Finca Golf or neighbouring Lo Romero courses start your day, followed by coffee at the clubhouse where English conversations flow naturally among British, Dutch, and Scandinavian residents. Afternoons might involve beach visits to Guardamar or La Mata – just 15-20 minutes by car – where you'll find golden sand, chiringuitos serving fresh seafood, and water sports. Evenings showcase traditional Spanish dining at local restaurants in the village square, where international homeowners mix with Spanish families over paella and local wines. The expat infrastructure is exceptional: English-speaking healthcare professionals, international schools within 25 minutes, and regular social events organised through golf clubs. Shopping is convenient with Mercadona in nearby Rojales (10 minutes) and larger centres in Torrevieja (20 minutes). Healthcare access is reassuring with Hospital de Torrevieja's modern facilities nearby and English-speaking doctors throughout the region. This is active, social living – not retirement isolation, but an integrated community of golf-loving adventurers.",

  "investmentSection": "This property sits at an inflection point in Algorfa's real estate cycle. The area has appreciated 12% year-on-year as investors recognise the gap between Algorfa values (€1,600/m² average) and coastal alternatives commanding €5,000+/m². At €2,530/m², this apartment commands a small premium to the village average, justified by La Finca Golf proximity and modern specification. The rental market validates strong investment fundamentals: comparable apartments achieve €900 per week during peak season (March-October), yielding potential 18-24% annual returns for active rental operators. British and Northern European demand for golf-accessible properties remains robust, with limited supply in this price range. Long-term appreciation prospects are supported by: limited new building permits in the immediate area, continued international golf tourism, improved transport links, and the zone's position between developed Torrevieja and pristine inland regions. Conservative projections suggest 8-10% annual appreciation as Algorfa matures, with rental income providing interim returns while capital appreciates.",
