The geography is blessed with dramatic salt-flat landscapes, pristine beaches, and a climate that guarantees 300+ days of sunshine annually. The town sits at sea level with protected blue waters ideal for swimming and water sports. Unlike overdeveloped tourist hubs, Pilar de La Horadada retains its character—local restaurants serve fresh seafood, weekly markets bustle with regional produce, and narrow streets lead to hidden plazas.

Afternoons invite leisurely beachside lunches, golf at championship courses nearby, or exploring the region's white villages. The weekly markets in the town center offer fresh fish, produce, and local crafts—a genuine Spanish experience. Healthcare is world-class with English-speaking doctors, modern facilities, and costs far below UK levels. Evenings feature tapas with neighbors, cultural events, or simply enjoying spectacular sunsets.

    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlänningar köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners can purchase property in Spain without restrictions. EU nationals, UK citizens with appropriate visas, and non-EU foreign nationals may all buy residential property. The process requires obtaining a Spanish tax identification number (NIE), opening a Spanish bank account, and working with a notary. Most property transactions are straightforward, with English-speaking legal support widely available in Pilar de La Horadada."
    },
    {
      "question": "Vilka är kostnaderna för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price of €255,000, expect additional costs including: notary fees (0.5-1%), property transfer tax (6-10%), land registry fees (0.1%), and legal fees (1-2%). Total additional costs typically range 8-15% of purchase price. Once owned, annual costs include property tax (0.4-1.1% of cadastral value), community fees if applicable, and utilities. These costs remain substantially lower than UK property ownership."
    },
    {
      "question": "Behöver jag visum för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "EU nationals require no visa to purchase Spanish property. UK nationals can buy property on tourist visas, though longer stays require appropriate residence visas. Non-EU nationals may require specific visa categories. Property ownership itself does not confer residency, though Spain offers residence visas for property owners meeting financial requirements. Consult your country's Spanish embassy for specific requirements."
    },

      "question": "Hur mycket är fastighetsskatten i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Spain's annual property tax (Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles - IBI) is typically 0.4-1.1% of the property's cadastral value, which is often lower than market value. This €255,000 property would likely incur annual IBI of €1,000-€2,000. Additionally, non-resident property owners pay 19% income tax on imputed rental value. Proper tax planning with a Spanish accountant minimizes tax obligations significantly."
    },
    {

      "answer": "Yes, foreigners can obtain Spanish mortgages through major banks and lenders. Most banks offer 70-80% loan-to-value mortgages with terms up to 30 years. EU nationals typically face fewer restrictions; UK nationals require appropriate visas. Interest rates are competitive—currently 3-4% for mortgage terms. Working with an English-speaking mortgage broker in Alicante simplifies the process and explains options clearly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur är levnadskostnaderna på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca offers exceptional value compared to UK and Northern Europe. Monthly living costs for one person typically range €1,200-€1,800 including rent, utilities, groceries, and dining. Healthcare and prescription costs are significantly lower. Pilar de La Horadada is more affordable than tourist resorts, with local restaurants offering three-course meals with wine for €10-€15.
