    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlänningar köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Yes. Foreign nationals have identical property purchase rights as Spanish citizens. No special permits are required, though non-residents must obtain a Spanish tax identification number (NIF). The straightforward legal framework and established market infrastructure make property acquisition accessible to international buyers. Professional legal advisors specializing in foreign acquisitions simplify the process and ensure compliance with all requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Vilka är kostnaderna för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect acquisition costs totaling approximately 7-10% of property value. These include: transfer tax (6-10% depending on region), notary fees (0.5-1%), property registration (0.1-0.5%), and professional legal/administrative services (2-3%). Mortgage-related costs, if financing, typically add 1-2%. These are standard costs integrated into the Spanish property acquisition process, with your advisor providing exact estimates based on individual circumstances."
    },
    {
      "question": "Behöver jag visum för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "No. Property purchase does not require a visa. Non-EU buyers should obtain a Spanish tax identification number (NIF), a straightforward administrative process facilitated through your legal advisor. EU citizens enjoy even streamlined access. The separation between property purchase rights and residency status means you can acquire and own property regardless of visa status, though residency regulations differ from ownership regulations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur mycket är fastighetsskatten i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Ongoing property taxes include IBI (Real Estate Tax), typically 0.4-1.1% of registered property value annually depending on location and property classification. Additional taxes may apply if the property generates rental income. Wealth tax applies to non-residents holding properties exceeding €600,000. Your financial advisor can model complete tax scenarios based on your specific residency status and property use intentions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jag få ett bolån i Spanien som utlänning?",
      "answer": "Yes. Foreign buyers can obtain mortgages from Spanish banks, typically financing 60-80% of property value depending on creditworthiness and documentation. Interest rates for foreign buyers may be marginally higher than for Spanish residents. Requirements include bank statements demonstrating financial capacity, identification documentation, and property appraisals. Specialists in foreign mortgages can coordinate between your home country bank and Spanish lenders to optimize terms."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur är levnadskostnaderna på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca offers cost of living approximately 20-30% lower than Northern European capitals and comparable to UK regional averages. Grocery costs are moderate with access to both premium products and budget supermarkets. Healthcare is exceptionally affordable for non-covered services. Utilities, dining, and entertainment reflect Mediterranean pricing. Retirees with modest pensions often find excellent lifestyle quality at reasonable cost, while investors benefit from favorable expense-to-rental-income ratios."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur är vädret på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Exceptional. Costa Blanca experiences 320+ days of annual sunshine with mild winters (average 13°C) and warm summers (average 27°C). Mediterranean breezes moderate summer heat while winter rainfall rarely exceeds 2-3 days monthly. The climate is among Spain's most favorable, supporting year-round outdoor activities from beach swimming to golf. This predictability makes the region ideal for retirees, outdoor enthusiasts, and those seeking reliable good weather year-round."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur långt är det från Sverige till Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Approximately 1,200 kilometers, with direct flights from Alicante Airport to London and major UK cities requiring 2-2.5 hours flight time. Regular daily flights from budget and traditional carriers ensure convenient connectivity. Many property owners maintain strong UK connections while enjoying Mediterranean residency. The balance of accessibility and distance provides the ideal separation—close enough for regular family visits, far enough to create psychological retreat from northern climates."
