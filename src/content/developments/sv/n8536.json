  "heroIntro": "Welcome to your peaceful retirement haven in Lomas de Campoamor, Orihuela Costa. This exceptional 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment offers the relaxed lifestyle you've been searching for, with year-round Mediterranean sunshine and a welcoming international expat community. Priced at €238,000, this property represents outstanding value—featuring premium specifications at 35% less than comparable properties on Costa Blanca North.\n\nLocated in one of Alicante's most sought-after coastal communities, this home combines modern comfort with the easy-going pace of life that makes retirement in Spain so appealing. With 109 square meters of thoughtfully designed living space, you'll enjoy everything from morning coffee on your terrace to evening strolls through tree-lined neighborhoods. The strong British, Scandinavian, and Dutch expat communities here mean you'll never feel isolated, while superb healthcare facilities and English-speaking medical professionals ensure your peace of mind.\n\nOrihuela Costa has earned its reputation as a premier retirement destination. Unlike the hustle of Costa Blanca North, this area offers authentic Spanish coastal living at genuinely affordable prices. Your €238,000 investment secures not just a property, but access to championship golf courses, pristine beaches, excellent shopping, and a lifestyle that balances activity with relaxation—exactly what the most discerning retirees are seeking.",
  "areaSection": "Orihuela Costa stretches along the southern reaches of Alicante's coastline, offering a distinctly different character from the busier northern regions. This area encompasses charming villages and residential communities like Lomas de Campoamor, each with its own personality while sharing the region's hallmarks: abundant sunshine (320+ days yearly), Mediterranean breezes, and crystalline waters. The terrain gently slopes toward the coast, creating natural neighborhoods with excellent views and drainage. The Costa Blanca's southern portion benefits from a slightly warmer microclimate, perfect for those seeking genuine warmth without excessive summer heat. Orihuela Costa has evolved into a mature, established community where infrastructure is well-developed and proven. Unlike newer speculative developments, this area has weathered decades of real estate cycles, demonstrating genuine long-term appeal to residents and investors alike.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Orihuela Costa revolves around leisure, community, and easy access to Spain's coastal pleasures. Your mornings might begin at a local café with café con leche and toast, chatting with fellow residents from across Europe. Shopping is stress-free—Mercadona, Consum, and Lidl are minutes away, supplemented by weekly village markets offering fresh produce. Healthcare is excellent: you're minutes from Hospital de Torrevieja and Quirónsalud, both equipped with English-speaking staff accustomed to international patients. The expat infrastructure here is mature and well-organized—book clubs, golf groups, beach walks, and cultural activities mean social life happens naturally. Beaches like La Zenia and Campoamor offer Blue Flag status and calm waters perfect for gentle swimming. Dining ranges from authentic Spanish chiringuitos (beach bars) to international restaurants catering to cosmopolitan tastes. The pace is distinctly relaxed—nobody rushes here—yet opportunity for activity is everywhere, from championship golf courses to yoga classes to coastal hiking trails.",
  "investmentSection": "Beyond being an excellent personal residence, this property represents sound financial judgment. Orihuela Costa properties have appreciated 10% year-on-year, outpacing inflation and creating genuine wealth building. At €238,000 (€2,183/m²), you're positioned just 4% above the area's €2,100/m² average—excellent value given the property's condition and location. Should you ever wish to rent it out, comparable apartments generate €800 per week in peak season, suggesting annual rental income potential of €30,000-€35,000 if you choose that route. The area's established international community ensures consistent rental demand. Most importantly, you're acquiring property at 35% less per square meter than Costa Blanca North developments, yet with equal or superior amenities and climate. This pricing differential reflects location preference, not quality—savvy investors have recognized Orihuela Costa's value for over two decades.",
  "conclusion": "This exceptional 2-bedroom apartment in Lomas de Campoamor represents far more than a property purchase—it's an invitation to the relaxed Mediterranean retirement lifestyle you've earned. At €238,000 with premium specifications at 35% less than comparable Costa Blanca North properties, the financial logic is compelling.
