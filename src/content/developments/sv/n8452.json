  "metaDescription": "Modern 35m² apartment in Torrevieja city center. New build, 300m from shops, bars & beaches. Ref: N8452",
  "heroIntro": "This contemporary 1-bedroom apartment represents an excellent opportunity in Torrevieja's vibrant downtown core. Located in Centro, just 300 meters from the bustling commercial district, this new build property offers modern convenience without compromise. At 35 square meters, the layout maximizes functionality for those seeking an urban lifestyle or investment opportunity in one of Costa Blanca's most dynamic destinations.\n\nTorrevieja has transformed significantly over the past decade, establishing itself as more than a traditional beach resort. The city center now hosts a thriving year-round community with international residents, young professionals, and retirees who value walkability and authentic Spanish culture. This apartment places you within immediate reach of that lifestyle—no car dependency required for daily essentials.\n\nThe property benefits from Torrevieja's strategic position on the Costa Blanca. The city serves as a gateway to both the northern beaches of Costa Dorada and the southern coastline toward Pilar de la Horada. Meanwhile, the city center offers its own distinct personality: galleries, cultural events, seafood restaurants along the marina, and a genuine neighborhood atmosphere that distinguishes it from purely tourism-focused developments.",
  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's rental market has matured significantly, driven by both summer tourism and year-round resident demand. The city center location commands premium rental rates compared to peripheral areas—short-term vacation rentals generate €50-70 per night during peak season, while long-term furnished rentals appeal to professionals and retirees seeking urban convenience. A 1-bedroom in this location typically achieves 60-70% occupancy annually when professionally managed. Operating costs remain reasonable: property taxes are modest, and the small size minimizes utilities and maintenance expenses. With purchase prices reasonable relative to comparable European cities, the investment returns stack favorably against other Costa Blanca options. The property appeals to diverse tenant profiles: young professionals, digital nomads, couples, and retirees—providing flexibility and reducing vacancy risk through diversified demand.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is 35m² truly livable as a primary residence?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Modern apartments of this size are designed as primary residences in major European cities. The key is purposeful layout—adequate bedroom, full bathroom, and efficient kitchen. Most residents find that spending time outside the apartment (restaurants, bars, waterfront walks) is the actual lifestyle appeal of city center living rather than spending time inside a large space."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are realistic rental income expectations for this property?",
      "answer": "High-season nightly rates (June-September) range €50-70. Low-season (November-March) drops to €30-45. Professional management achieves 60-70% occupancy annually. Conservative estimates suggest €8,000-12,000 annual rental income, which provides 4-6% return on modest purchase prices. Long-term furnished rentals at €600-900 monthly offer more predictable income."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why would someone choose a small city center apartment over a larger property outside town?",
      "answer": "Different priorities—urban dwellers value walkability, cultural amenities, and lower daily costs over square meters. No car needed, restaurants and bars become your living room, and maintenance is minimal. For investors, high turnover rental potential and lower operating costs provide better returns than larger peripheral properties with lower occupancy rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the actual development and infrastructure quality in Centro Torrevieja?",
      "answer": "Torrevieja's city center has matured considerably. This area has established water, electricity, sewage systems, broadband internet, and regular municipal services. It's not a developing area—it's an established neighborhood with existing community, local commerce, and stable infrastructure. New build standards ensure modern construction quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Torrevieja compare to other Costa Blanca destinations for buyers?",
      "answer": "Torrevieja offers authentic urban experience and resident community rather than resort atmosphere. It's more affordable than Alicante or coastal Benidorm, more Spanish than purely tourist destinations, and offers genuine year-round population and culture. The trade-off: less manicured than planned resort communities, more genuine than designed holiday destinations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there restrictions on foreign property ownership in Spain?",
      "answer": "No. EU and non-EU citizens can purchase property freely in Spain. You'll need an NIE (tax identification number) and should consult a gestoría (tax advisor) for residency and tax implications. Many property agents handle preliminary documentation assistance for international buyers."
