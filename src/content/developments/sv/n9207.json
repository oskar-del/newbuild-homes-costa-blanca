  "metaDescription": "€235,000 3-bedroom apartment in San Javier. Premium spec, 40% less than islands. Strong rental yields, +8% annual appreciation. Buy now.",
  "heroIntro": "This 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Santiago de la Ribera represents a compelling investment opportunity in one of Costa Blanca's most sought-after markets. Priced at €235,000 (€3,013/m²), it sits at a 37% premium to the San Javier average of €2,200/m², but delivers premium specifications at 40% less than comparable Spanish island markets. For investors seeking rental income, the numbers work: typical holiday lets in this location command €800 per week, translating to robust annual yields. The property benefits from San Javier's consistent +8% year-on-year capital appreciation trend, making it an attractive hedge against inflation. With 22 high-quality images documenting the 78m² layout, this apartment is ready to generate immediate returns through the thriving short-term rental market while building long-term equity appreciation.",
  "areaSection": "San Javier is a coastal municipality in the Region of Murcia, strategically positioned between the Mar Menor lagoon and the Mediterranean. This distinctive geography creates a unique microclimate—warmer and drier than northern Spanish regions, with 320+ days of sunshine annually. The town sits just 40 minutes from Alicante International Airport, making it accessible yet removed from mass tourism corridors. Santiago de la Ribera, the beachfront neighborhood, has undergone significant modernization in recent years, attracting both European investors and permanent residents. The combination of natural beauty (the Mar Menor is the world's largest hypersaline lagoon), excellent infrastructure, and genuine community development has positioned San Javier as one of Murcia's most resilient property markets.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in San Javier revolves around a relaxed Mediterranean rhythm with sophisticated amenities. The established expatriate community—particularly British, Scandinavian, and German residents—has created an English-friendly environment where language barriers are minimal. Local restaurants range from traditional Spanish tapas bars to contemporary coastal dining, with fresh seafood as the staple. Blue Flag beaches are accessible within 20 minutes, offering both family swimming and water sports. The area supports championship golf courses, tennis clubs, and cycling routes along the Mar Menor. Healthcare is excellent with English-speaking doctors in private clinics and a regional hospital within 30 minutes. Mercadona, Lidl, and local markets provide all shopping necessities, while the compact size means most daily activities are within walking or short driving distance.",
  "investmentSection": "The investment fundamentals are solid. At €3,013/m², this property commands a premium within San Javier's market but delivers value when compared to equivalent properties in Mallorca, Menorca, or the Canary Islands—typically 40% more expensive for similar specifications. San Javier's consistent +8% annual appreciation means this €235,000 investment could reach €254,000+ within 12 months based on market trends. Rental income provides immediate cash flow: at €800 per week (conservative estimate for a 3-bedroom), annual rental revenue reaches €41,600, delivering a gross yield of 17.7% before expenses. Even accounting for 25% operating costs (utilities, maintenance, management), net yields exceed 13%, significantly outperforming European stock markets. The Mar Menor's growing appeal to international tourists and the region's infrastructure improvements suggest sustainable demand for quality rental properties.",
  "conclusion": "This €235,000 apartment in Santiago de la Ribera represents calculated investment, not speculation. The numbers demonstrate compelling rental yields (13%+ net), consistent capital appreciation (+8% annually), and accessibility to international markets via Alicante Airport. At 40% less than Spanish island prices, it delivers premium specifications at genuine value. The established expatriate infrastructure means property management, healthcare, and administration are straightforward for non-resident investors. With 22 professional photographs documenting the property and immediate rental demand from the Mar Menor's growing international appeal, this apartment is ready to generate income while building equity.
