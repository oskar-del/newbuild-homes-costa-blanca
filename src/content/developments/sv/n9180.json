  "heroIntro": "Welcome to a rare opportunity in Torrevieja's most sought-after location. This modern new build 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment (Reference N9180) sits in the vibrant heart of Centro, just 600 meters from the Mediterranean shoreline. Part of an exclusive boutique development of only 7 residences, this property represents the sweet spot for Costa Blanca living—offering genuine walkability to urban conveniences without sacrificing that essential coastal proximity.\n\nTorrevieja has undergone significant transformation in recent years, evolving from a traditional fishing village into a cosmopolitan coastal destination. The Centro district specifically has become the epicenter of this renaissance, attracting a diverse mix of permanent residents, second-home owners, and investors seeking authentic Mediterranean lifestyle. This apartment capitalizes on that desirability with contemporary finishes and thoughtful design that appeals to modern sensibilities.\n\nWith 101 square meters of intelligently laid-out space, this residence provides comfortable living for couples, small families, or investors targeting the rental market. The proximity to Torrevieja's expanding restaurant scene, cultural venues, and the beaches makes this location particularly valuable for those who want to experience authentic Costa Blanca living rather than isolated resort-style developments.",
  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's rental market has experienced steady growth as the town's reputation as a quality coastal destination has strengthened. The Centro location specifically attracts premium rental rates compared to outlying developments. Properties in the walkable urban core appeal to short-term holiday rentals (through platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo) during peak seasons, while also attracting long-term tenants seeking authentic neighborhood living rather than isolated resort communities. The 2-bedroom configuration aligns well with both target markets—families for holiday rentals and couples or remote workers for annual lets. With Torrevieja attracting increasing numbers of digital nomads and remote workers choosing Mediterranean bases, the demand for well-located urban apartments continues strengthening. Historical rental yields in Centro Torrevieja properties range from 5-7%, with well-managed properties achieving higher returns through mixed booking strategies.",
