  "metaDescription": "2-bedroom bungalow at La Finca Golf, Algorfa. €299,000. Golf lifestyle, modern design, 50% less than coastal towns. Premium specification.",
  "heroIntro": "Welcome to La Finca Golf, where your golf lifestyle becomes your daily reality. This 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom bungalow (ref: N9317) represents a rare opportunity to own a premium-specification home at €299,000—50% less than comparable properties in coastal Costa Blanca towns. Situated within the prestigious La Finca Golf resort in Algorfa, you're not just buying a home; you're gaining access to championship courses, a vibrant golfer's paradise, and an international community of like-minded enthusiasts. The 74m² of thoughtfully designed living space maximizes comfort and functionality, perfect for those who value efficiency without compromising on quality. At €4,041 per m², this property offers exceptional value compared to the Algorfa average of €1,600/m², reflecting its premium finishes and prime location within the resort. Whether you're a serious golfer seeking a second home or an investor eyeing the +12% year-on-year market growth, this bungalow combines lifestyle appeal with solid financial potential. The golf community here speaks English, ensuring seamless integration into resort life, while proximity to Torrevieja and Guardamar beaches provides perfect balance between fairway focus and coastal relaxation.",
  "areaSection": "Algorfa is a charming inland village in southern Alicante, positioned at the heart of the Costa Blanca's golf region. Located 30 minutes from Alicante Airport and just 15 minutes from the Mediterranean beaches, Algorfa offers the perfect compromise between authentic Spanish village life and modern resort amenities. The area enjoys a year-round Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine, making it ideal for golf enthusiasts. Nestled between Torrevieja and Rojales, Algorfa has evolved into a thriving residential hub for expat communities seeking authentic Spanish living without sacrificing convenience. The village maintains its traditional Spanish character—narrow streets, local tapas bars, weekly markets—while hosting world-class golf facilities that have put it firmly on the map for serious players. The backdrop of countryside and almond groves creates a peaceful, authentic setting rare in coastal developments.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Algorfa means embracing a slower pace without isolation. Your days revolve around the fairway: morning rounds at La Finca Golf or one of four nearby championship courses, lunch at the clubhouse, afternoons exploring the village's authentic Spanish character. The expat community here is predominantly golf-focused and English-speaking, creating natural social networks through resort activities and the 19th hole culture. Evenings bring tapas bar culture—locals and residents mixing in whitewashed bodegas serving regional wines and jamón ibérico. Weekly village markets offer fresh produce and local crafts, while supermarkets (Mercadona 10 minutes away) provide all modern conveniences. The international golf community creates an active lifestyle: tournaments, social mixers, and coaching clinics are regular fixtures. Torrevieja (20 minutes) offers broader shopping, restaurants, and beaches for day trips. Healthcare is excellent, with a local health center and Hospital de Torrevieja providing English-speaking medical professionals. This is resort living with authentic Spanish roots—not a bubble, but a curated lifestyle.",
  "investmentSection": "The Costa Blanca property market is experiencing +12% year-on-year growth, with Algorfa and golf communities leading the surge. At €299,000, this bungalow occupies a sweet spot: below oversaturated coastal markets, yet in a niche with sustained demand. Rental potential is strong—typical 7-night holiday lets command €900, translating to €46,800 annually if rented 13 weeks per year, or €70,200 at full capacity. Golf tourism to the region is climbing, with properties on or near championship courses commanding premium rental rates. The gated resort setting reduces vacancy risk and maintenance costs compared to standalone villas. Long-term appreciation is supported by the limited supply of new builds in prime golf locations, changing lifestyle demographics (increasing demand from retirees seeking active living), and coastal overflow pushing buyers inland. This is not speculative flipping—it's steady appreciation in a specialized market with loyal, recurring tenants.",
  "conclusion": "This 2-bedroom bungalow at La Finca Golf represents a rare convergence: championship golf access, premium specification, and exceptional value. At €299,000, you're not just buying a home—you're purchasing membership in a thriving international golf community, direct fairway access, and a location appreciating at +12% annually. Whether seeking a retirement haven, a golf-focused second home, or an investment with solid rental potential, this property delivers. The setup is perfect for serious players: morning rounds at La Finca, lunch at the clubhouse, afternoons exploring four additional championship courses, evenings in village tapas bars, weekends at Mediterranean beaches. Algorfa has quietly become Spain's premier golf destination for those balancing active lifestyle with authentic Spanish living.
