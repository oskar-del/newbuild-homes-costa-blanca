The region's geography creates natural microclimates, with Playa Flamenca positioned to maximize sea views and minimize excessive heat. Unlike overcrowded northern Costa Blanca areas, Orihuela Costa maintains an authentic balance between development and natural landscape, with extensive pine forests and protected dune systems preserving environmental integrity. The area encompasses multiple coastal villages including Playa Flamenca, Campoamor, Cabo Roig, and Punta Prima, each with distinct character but united by Mediterranean charm. Investment in infrastructure has transformed Orihuela Costa into a modern resort destination while maintaining the relaxed elegance that attracts selective international buyers seeking genuine Spanish coastal living.",
