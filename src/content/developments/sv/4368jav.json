  "metaTitle": "5-Bed Apartment Javea €395,000 - Havsutsikts Investment",
  "metaDescription": "5-bedroom apartment in Javea center, €395,000. Sea views, competitive pricing. Strong rental potential on Costa Blanca.",
  "heroIntro": "This 5-bedroom apartment in central Javea represents a compelling investment opportunity on the Costa Blanca. Priced at €395,000—aligned with Javea's €3,200/m² average—the property offers genuine value in a market experiencing consistent +6% year-on-year appreciation. For buy-to-let investors, Javea's established tourism infrastructure delivers reliable rental income: typical holiday lets command €1,400 per week, translating to substantial annual yields. The location in the town center maximizes accessibility for holiday renters seeking walkable proximity to beaches, restaurants, and amenities. Unlike comparable Mallorca properties commanding 30% premium pricing, this apartment provides capital appreciation potential with lower entry costs. The sea views add rental appeal, justifying higher nightly rates during peak season. With 40 images available, the property's presentation supports premium positioning in the competitive holiday rental market.",
  "areaSection": "Javea (Jávea) occupies the northeastern Costa Blanca, characterized by dramatic cliff formations, Mediterranean pine forests, and a genuine working harbor distinct from mass-tourism developments. The town experiences 320+ sunshine days annually with mild winters (average 15°C) and warm summers (28°C), creating year-round appeal for seasonal renters. Geography is defined by three distinct beaches and numerous coves, with the town center positioned between the port area and Arenal Beach. The combination of natural beauty, established infrastructure, and authentic character attracts diverse visitor demographics—from families to couples to golf enthusiasts. Unlike Benidorm's high-rise sprawl 30km south, Javea maintains architectural coherence and preserves green spaces, commanding premium positioning within the Costa Blanca market.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Javea revolves around Mediterranean rhythms with distinctly international character. The established British, German, and Dutch communities (representing 40%+ of residents) ensure English is universally spoken—critical for expat property owners managing rentals remotely. The paseo (waterfront promenade) offers numerous restaurants serving both Spanish and international cuisine, with many establishments specifically catering to English-speaking diners. Weekly markets at Plaza de la Constitucion provide fresh produce and local goods. Healthcare access is exceptional: Hospital de Dénia operates 15 minutes away with abundant English-speaking private practitioners. Shopping combines traditional Spanish retailers (Mercadona, Consum) with specialist expat stores like the British Corner Shop. For investors, this cultural infrastructure reduces management complexity—rental guests find comprehensive English-language support, simplifying turnover and guest communications.",
  "investmentSection": "Javea's investment fundamentals strengthen annually. The +6% year-on-year price appreciation outpaces general Spanish property markets, reflecting consistent demand from Northern European purchasers. Holiday letting yields remain substantial: €1,400 weekly rates across 30-35 weeks annually generate €42,000-49,000 gross rental income—potential 10.6-12.4% gross yield on this €395,000 purchase. Central location maximizes booking frequencies: walkable beach access and restaurant proximity attract premium-paying guests. Compared to equivalent Mallorca properties (30% more expensive), Javea delivers superior cash-on-cash returns. The established expat infrastructure reduces management friction—English-speaking property managers, contractors, and guest services operate seamlessly. Capital appreciation combines with rental cash flow, addressing both income and wealth-building investment objectives.",
  "conclusion": "This 5-bedroom apartment represents genuine value positioning at Javea's competitive €395,000 price point. Investors combining capital appreciation objectives (+6% year-on-year market trajectory) with reliable holiday rental income (€1,400/week potential, 10-12% gross yields) find aligned fundamentals. Center location, sea views, and comprehensive amenities infrastructure support both personal use and premium guest positioning. The established English-language expatriate community simplifies remote property management—differentiating advantage versus less-developed Costa Blanca regions. With 40 professional images documenting the property's appeal and proximity to employment-adjacent amenities (beaches, restaurants, international schools), booking conversion potential remains high.
