  "areaSection": "Guardamar del Segura is a coastal municipality in southern Alicante, nestled between Torrevieja and the Mar Menor. This charming town of approximately 13,000 residents sits at the mouth of the Segura River, offering a distinctive geography of protected dune systems and natural salt marshes that create dramatic, ever-changing landscapes. The climate is exceptional—over 320 days of annual sunshine with mild winters and warm summers tempered by Mediterranean breezes. Unlike busier neighbouring towns, Guardamar has maintained its authentic Spanish character while quietly attracting a growing community of British, Scandinavian, and other European residents seeking genuine value and authentic coastal living. The town's strategic location provides easy access to major amenities in Torrevieja (15 minutes) and Alicante (45 minutes), while maintaining a peaceful, unhurried atmosphere that feels genuinely Spanish rather than tourist-oriented.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Guardamar del Segura revolves around genuine, unpretentious living. Your mornings might begin with a coffee at the Wednesday market, where local farmers sell fresh produce and fishmongers offer the day's catch. The expat community here is well-established but discreet—you'll find English-speaking friends at local restaurants and social groups, but without the overwhelming expat bubble of larger resorts. Beaches are your backyard: Playa Centro with its Blue Flag status, or quieter alternatives like La Roqueta and Les Ortigues, all within walking distance or a short drive. Afternoons might include a round at one of three excellent golf courses nearby, shopping at modern supermarkets (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum), or enjoying fresh seafood overlooking the water. The healthcare system is outstanding—Hospital de Torrevieja is just 15 minutes away, and local health centers provide routine care. Evenings reveal the town's culinary charm: family-run restaurants serving regional paella, fresh fish, and local wines at sensible prices. This is authentic Mediterranean retirement—not a theme park, but a real place where real people live well.",
