Professional property management companies handle bookings and maintenance, typically charging 20-30% commission."
    },
    {
      "question": "Behöver jag visum för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "No, you do not require a visa specifically to purchase property in Spain—the property transaction and ownership are separate from visa/residency requirements. However, if planning extended stays (over 90 days), you'll need appropriate visa status. UK retirees can apply for the Non-Lucrative Visa (renewable annually) if demonstrating financial means of approximately €27,792 annual income. Spanish residency involves separate processes from property purchase but offers tax benefits and healthcare access."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Guardamar del Segura better than Torrevieja for retirees?",
      "answer": "Both towns appeal to retirees but serve different preferences. Guardamar del Segura offers quieter, more authentic Spanish atmosphere with genuine community integration, smaller town convenience, and lower property costs. Torrevieja provides more entertainment, international dining options, larger expat community, and more developed infrastructure. Guardamar suits retirees seeking peaceful authenticity and cultural engagement, while Torrevieja appeals to those preferring bustling social scenes and familiar international amenities. Guardamar's proximity to Torrevieja (20 minutes) allows enjoying both."
