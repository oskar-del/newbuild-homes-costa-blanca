    {
      "question": "Vilka är kostnaderna för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Beyond the €465,000 purchase price, expect 6-8% in additional costs: property transfer tax (3-5%), legal fees (0.5-1%), notary fees (0.2-0.5%), and land registry (0.1%).

    },
    {
      "question": "Hur är vädret på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys 300+ days of annual sunshine with mild winters (12-18°C) and warm summers (25-32°C).

    },
