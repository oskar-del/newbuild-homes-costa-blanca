  "areaSection": "Polop is a distinctive hilltop municipality positioned strategically between the vibrant coast and the serene inland valleys of Alicante province. Situated approximately 40km north of Alicante Airport, the town rises 340 meters above sea level, commanding panoramic vistas across the Mediterranean and surrounding mountain ranges. The microclimate offers mild winters and warm, dry summers—ideal for year-round Mediterranean living without the intensity found in lower-lying coastal areas. Polop's strategic position places it equidistant between the bustling energy of major coastal centers and the peaceful natural reserves of the interior. This geographic advantage has transformed the municipality into a hub for international property investment, where European buyers appreciate authentic Spanish culture alongside modern conveniences and reliable infrastructure.",
