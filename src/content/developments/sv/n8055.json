  "metaDescription": "3-bedroom apartment Orihuela Costa €369,000. Premium spec, 35% below Costa Blanca Nord. Strong rental yield potential, high demand location.",
  "heroIntro": "This 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Lomas de Cabo Roig represents a compelling investment opportunity on the Costa Blanca. Priced at €369,000—a premium specification property that sits 35% below comparable Costa Blanca North pricing—this 93m² home offers exceptional value in a market experiencing steady 10% year-on-year appreciation. The investment case is compelling: Orihuela Costa attracts consistent holiday rental demand, with typical weekly rates reaching €800, generating meaningful rental income for owner-occupiers. The property's location in an established, mature residential area with strong expat infrastructure ensures year-round occupancy potential. Whether you're seeking capital appreciation, passive rental income, or a combination of both, this apartment delivers measurable financial performance metrics that justify the acquisition cost.",
  "areaSection": "Orihuela Costa is a mature coastal development in southern Alicante, spanning approximately 20km along the Mediterranean shoreline. The area encompasses established neighborhoods like Lomas de Cabo Roig, Campoamor, and Playa Flamenca, developed primarily between the 1970s and 2010s. The Mediterranean climate delivers 300+ days of sunshine annually, with average temperatures of 18°C in winter and 28°C in summer. Elevation varies from sea-level beach communities to hillside neighborhoods offering panoramic views. The region sits 50km south of Alicante airport and 15km north of the Murcia border. Orihuela Costa's geography—bounded by salt lagoons (Laguna de La Mata and Laguna Torrevieja) to the west and Mediterranean beaches to the east—creates distinctive microclimates and diverse recreational opportunities.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Orihuela Costa centers on outdoor living, with residents enjoying year-round access to Mediterranean beaches, golf courses, and dining. The expat community—predominantly British, Scandinavian, and Dutch—has created an English-speaking infrastructure that makes settling straightforward. Neighborhood amenities include modern supermarkets (Mercadona, Consum, Lidl), weekly markets, and La Zenia Boulevard shopping center. Healthcare quality is high, with English-speaking medical professionals available at local clinics and major hospitals within 15-20 minutes. Restaurants range from traditional Spanish establishments to international cuisine catering to diverse tastes. Social infrastructure is strong: golf clubs, beach clubs, and expat social organizations provide community connection. The region attracts retirees, young families, and investors seeking Mediterranean lifestyle without major city pressures.",
  "investmentSection": "The investment fundamentals are quantifiable. Orihuela Costa's property market demonstrates consistent 10% year-on-year appreciation, outperforming many coastal European markets. This apartment's €3,968/m² pricing sits substantially below the Costa Blanca North average (€5,958/m²), indicating undervaluation relative to comparable specifications. Rental yield analysis shows strong potential: typical holiday let rates reach €800 per week (€3,200+ monthly), suggesting 10-12% annual gross yields before management costs. The market captures multiple demand segments: British retirees, holiday-home seekers, and younger investors. The established infrastructure—healthcare, education, transportation—supports long-term value retention. Exit opportunities remain favorable given consistent buyer demand and transparent pricing markets. Capital appreciation combined with active rental income creates dual-return investment dynamics.",
  "conclusion": "This 3-bedroom apartment in Lomas de Cabo Roig represents a quantifiably attractive investment opportunity. The €369,000 price point—premium specification at 35% below Costa Blanca North comparables—combines capital appreciation potential (10% year-on-year market growth) with proven rental income (€800+ weekly). The established infrastructure, English-speaking services, and mature expat community minimize operational complexity for non-resident owners. Healthcare access, international education options, and comprehensive amenities support both personal use and managed rental strategies. Property management services are competitively available, enabling passive ownership structures. For investors seeking Mediterranean exposure with transparent market dynamics, dual-return potential, and established community infrastructure, this property merits serious consideration.
