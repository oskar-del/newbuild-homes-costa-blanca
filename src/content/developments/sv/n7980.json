  "heroIntro": "This 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment in Benijófar represents a compelling investment opportunity on the Costa Blanca. Priced at €263,000 (€4,311/m²), it offers premium specification at 40% less than comparable Spanish island markets, making it an attractive entry point for investors seeking reliable rental income and capital appreciation. The Costa Blanca property market has demonstrated consistent growth of approximately 8% year-on-year, positioning this apartment in a location with strong fundamentals for both holiday letting and long-term appreciation. The typical weekly rental rate for similar properties in Benijófar reaches €800, translating to substantial annual income potential. Benijófar itself has become increasingly popular among international investors due to its proximity to Alicante, established expat community, and lower acquisition costs compared to beachfront alternatives. With 14 professional images showcasing the property's features, this 61m² apartment offers the efficiency and appeal that attracts both short-term holiday renters and long-term tenants seeking modern Costa Blanca accommodation.",
  "areaSection": "Benijófar is a strategically positioned town in the Vega Baja region of Alicante, approximately 35 kilometers south of Alicante city and just 20 minutes from the coast. This inland location provides a significant cost advantage while maintaining excellent accessibility to beaches, airports, and amenities. The town experiences the classic Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually, mild winters, and warm summers—ideal conditions for year-round holiday letting. Benijófar has evolved from a traditional agricultural community into a modern residential destination, attracting European investors seeking value without sacrificing quality of life. The town's infrastructure has modernized substantially, with new building developments creating contemporary housing stock alongside established neighborhoods. Its position between the coast and inland attractions makes it a natural hub for investors capitalizing on both tourism and residential demand.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Benijófar offers the practical benefits that appeal to investors managing properties remotely. The established international community means English is widely spoken, facilitating property management and rental operations. Daily necessities are easily accessed through major supermarkets including Mercadona, Lidl, and Consum, plus authentic weekly markets offering local produce. The town has evolved with modern restaurants, cafes, and leisure facilities catering to both residents and tourists. Healthcare is readily available through private clinics and the regional hospital system with English-speaking doctors—essential reassurance for property owners concerned about operational disruptions. The expat infrastructure is mature, meaning property management companies, legal services, and rental agencies understand investor needs. Within 20 minutes, residents access multiple Blue Flag beaches ideal for attracting holiday renters.

  "investmentSection": "Benijófar's property market demonstrates fundamental investment strength. The €4,311/m² pricing for this premium property contrasts sharply with the €2,200/m² area average, positioning premium new-build stock as the recognized value segment. Market analysis indicates +8% year-on-year appreciation, outpacing broader Spanish real estate trends. Holiday rental yields are particularly attractive: typical weekly rates of €800 generate €41,600 annually at 65% occupancy (realistic for managed holiday lets), translating to approximately 15.8% gross yield before expenses. Even conservative 50% occupancy scenarios produce €20,800 in annual revenue. Long-term appreciation combined with rental income creates dual wealth-building mechanisms. Investors benefit from Benijófar's accessibility to Alicante's international airport while avoiding premium pricing of beach-adjacent properties. The established expat community has created professional property management infrastructure, reducing operational complexity for remote owners. Tax-efficient structures exist for non-resident property investors, and the Spanish mortgage market increasingly accommodates foreign buyers.",
