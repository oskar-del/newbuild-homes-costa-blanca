    {
      "question": "Hur mycket kostar denna fastighet?",
      "answer": "€313,500. This represents exceptional value for a premium-specification villa with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a 439m² plot. Monthly mortgage payments (with 30% deposit and 25-year term) would be approximately €1,100-1,200, making it affordable for most UK professional families. This price includes no hidden costs—you're buying a complete, ready-to-occupy family home."
    },
    {
      "question": "Är Costa Blanca en bra plats att köpa fastighet?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Costa Blanca combines affordability (40% less than Balearic Islands), excellent Mediterranean climate, established infrastructure, and strong rental demand. Property values here have appreciated 8% annually. Unlike coastal resort areas, inland locations like Hondón de las Nieves maintain authenticity while offering modern amenities, making them ideal for families seeking long-term homes rather than investment speculation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlänningar köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Yes, without restriction. Non-residents and non-EU citizens can purchase Spanish property identically to Spanish nationals. You'll need an NIE (Número de Identidad de Extranjero) number and Spanish tax identification, which are straightforward to obtain. Most property conveyancers handle this automatically. You do not need to be a resident to buy property in Spain, making it ideal for UK buyers purchasing before relocating."
    },

Total closing costs typically run 10-12% of purchase price. For a €313,500 villa, this means approximately €31,000-37,000 additional costs. Mortgage arrangements may require additional surveys (€500-800). These are lower than UK conveyancing on equivalent properties."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jag få ett bolån i Spanien som utlänning?",
      "answer": "Yes, most British banks and Spanish banks offer mortgages to non-residents purchasing in Spain. Spanish banks typically offer 70% LTV (30% deposit required), 25-year terms, and interest rates of 3.5-4.5% depending on rates and your profile.

Rainfall occurs mainly October-April but remains moderate. Snow is extremely rare. This climate eliminates heating costs, reduces weather-related depression, and enables year-round outdoor activities.

    },
