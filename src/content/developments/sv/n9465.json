  "areaSection": "Torrevieja sits on the southern Costa Blanca, where the Alicante coastline curves into dramatic salt lagoons and golden beaches. The town has evolved from a quiet fishing village into a thriving Mediterranean hub, yet retains its authentic Spanish character. The Centro location puts you at the heart of this transformation—close enough to enjoy the vibrant pulse of restaurants, bars, and markets, yet peaceful enough for genuine relaxation. The climate is consistently exceptional: 320 days of sunshine annually, with mild winters (rarely below 8°C) and warm summers tempered by sea breezes. This geography creates the perfect year-round holiday atmosphere. The town's position—just 50km south of Alicante—places you strategically between the cosmopolitan north and the quieter, more authentic south, offering the best of both worlds.",
