  "areaSection": "Finestrat is a picturesque coastal municipality in Alicante province, positioned along the Mediterranean coast between Benidorm and Calpe. The area benefits from a Mediterranean climate with 300+ days of annual sunshine, warm summers (28-30°C), and mild winters (12-15°C). Cala de Finestrat specifically occupies a prime beachfront location with dramatic limestone cliffs and coves that define the Costa Blanca landscape. The municipality maintains a population of approximately 3,500, creating a quieter alternative to nearby Benidorm while retaining full urban amenities. The terrain features the stunning Sierra de Aitana mountain range backdrop, contributing to the area's natural appeal and outdoor recreation opportunities. Investment activity has intensified as international buyers recognize Finestrat's strategic position—close enough to Benidorm's tourism infrastructure yet far enough removed to avoid overcrowding. The established vacation rental market, combined with residential demand, creates dual-income potential for property investors.",
