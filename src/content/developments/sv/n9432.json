    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlänningar köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Yes. Non-EU and EU nationals can freely purchase property in Spain with minimal restrictions. You'll need a Spanish tax identification number (NIE), but the process is straightforward through a Spanish lawyer. Foreign ownership is fully protected under Spanish law, and many expat-focused legal services specialize in property transactions for international buyers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur är levnadskostnaderna på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Cost of living in Costa Blanca is significantly lower than northern Europe.

    },
    {
      "question": "Hur långt är det från Sverige till Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Alicante is approximately 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) from London, translating to roughly 2.5-3 hours flying time. Multiple daily flights connect Alicante to major UK airports (London, Manchester, Birmingham), making visits home convenient and affordable—return flights often cost €80-150 when booked in advance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur är vädret på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys Mediterranean climate with 300+ annual sunshine days, average temperatures of 18°C in winter (December-February) and 30°C in summer (June-August). Rainfall is minimal (200-300mm annually), concentrated in autumn/spring. This predictable, mild weather is ideal for outdoor living and eliminates harsh winter conditions common in northern Europe."
    },
    {
      "question": "Vilka är kostnaderna för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Beyond purchase price, expect acquisition costs of 8-10%: property transfer tax (6-8% depending on region), notary fees (€500-1,500), lawyer fees (€1,000-2,000), and registration costs. Annual property tax runs 0.4-0.9% of cadastral value (typically lower than actual purchase price). These costs are substantially lower than UK property transactions, and Spanish lawyers typically handle entire process efficiently."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jag få ett bolån i Spanien som utlänning?",
      "answer": "Yes. Most Spanish banks offer mortgages to foreign nationals, typically covering 60-70% of property value with interest rates around 3-4%. Non-resident foreigners may face slightly stricter documentation requirements, but it's routine. Many buyers successfully finance Spanish properties, and Spanish mortgages often carry favorable terms compared to international alternatives."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the rental potential for properties in Rojales?",
      "answer": "Strong. Comparable 2-bedroom bungalows in Rojales generate €700-900 per week during peak season (April-October), averaging €3,200-3,600 monthly. Off-season rentals run €400-600 weekly. With professional management handling bookings and maintenance, net rental yields reach 4-5% annually—solid supplementary income during retirement or full-time investment strategy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is this property cheaper than island alternatives?",
      "answer": "Inland Rojales avoids the premium pricing of beachfront and island properties, while maintaining proximity to beaches (20 minutes). Spanish island properties command 40-60% premiums due to tourism demand and limited supply. This bungalow delivers equivalent quality and lifestyle benefits at substantially lower cost—intelligent real estate arbitrage for value-conscious buyers."
