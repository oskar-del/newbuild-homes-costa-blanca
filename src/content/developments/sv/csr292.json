  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Hur mycket kostar denna fastighet?",
      "answer": "€470,000. This 3-bedroom villa includes comprehensive modern specifications with 200m² living space on a secure 241m² plot. The price represents excellent value at €2,350/m² compared to comparable island markets. Standard Spanish mortgage options are available for qualifying buyers, with typical terms of 20-25 years at current rates around 3.5-4%. No hidden costs are included in the advertised price; additional costs include transfer taxes (around 10%), legal fees (approximately 1%), and optional home insurance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlänningar köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Non-Spanish citizens can freely purchase property in Spain with minimal restrictions. You'll need an NIE (tax identification number), which Spanish solicitors obtain as part of the purchase process. The procedure is straightforward with established legal frameworks protecting foreign buyers. British citizens post-Brexit have the same property purchase rights as other non-EU nationals. Legal representation is essential, and reputable English-speaking solicitors throughout Costa Blanca specialise in international purchases."
    },
    {
      "question": "Vilka är kostnaderna för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect approximately 10-11% in additional costs. Transfer tax varies by region (Alicante is 8%), legal fees run 1-1.5% of purchase price, notary fees approximately 0.5%, and property registration around 0.5-1%. If obtaining financing, mortgage arrangement fees typically cost 0.5-1%. Surveyor fees (optional but recommended) range €400-800. For this €470,000 property, total acquisition costs would typically range €50,000-55,000. These costs are standard across Spain and are clearly itemised before commitment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jag få ett bolån i Spanien som utlänning?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers can obtain Spanish mortgages with competitive interest rates. Most lenders require 30-40% deposit, offer 20-25 year terms, and accept employment income from abroad. Requirements include valid NIE, proof of income (typically last 2-3 years accounts or employment contracts), and credit history assessment. Interest rates currently hover around 3.5-4% for fixed terms, making Spanish mortgages attractive compared to UK rates. Working with English-speaking mortgage brokers specialising in expat lending streamlines the application process significantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur är levnadskostnaderna på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Overall cost of living is approximately 30-40% lower than equivalent UK provision. Utilities (electricity, water, internet) cost €80-150 monthly depending on usage. Supermarket shopping for a family of four runs €400-600 monthly. International school fees range €4,000-8,000 annually depending on institution. Restaurant meals cost €10-18 per person for quality establishments. Healthcare costs are minimal with private insurance around €80-150 monthly. Property maintenance and garden care cost significantly less than UK equivalents. These combined factors make quality family living genuinely affordable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Är Costa Blanca en bra plats att köpa fastighet?",
      "answer": "Yes, Costa Blanca remains an excellent property investment destination. The market has experienced consistent 8% year-on-year appreciation, with Polop specifically positioned for continued growth as an emerging family destination. Infrastructure improvements continue throughout the region with excellent airport access, modernised road networks, and improving healthcare facilities. International demand remains strong from Northern European buyers seeking affordable Mediterranean living.

The combination of lifestyle appeal, affordability, and market fundamentals makes Costa Blanca particularly attractive for family relocations."
    },

Winter months (December-February) average 15-18°C during day, 8-10°C at night—mild by Northern European standards but requiring occasional jumper and light heating. Spring and autumn provide perfect temperatures (20-25°C) ideal for outdoor activities without summer intensity. Rainfall averages 40-50cm annually, heavily concentrated in autumn and spring. The climate supports year-round outdoor living, with many families reporting health improvements from increased sunshine and outdoor activity levels."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur långt är det från Sverige till Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Alicante airport is approximately 1,300 miles from London, requiring 2.5-3 hours direct flight time.

Return flights typically cost £40-120 depending on season and advance booking. The journey remains manageable for regular UK visits, with families often visiting quarterly while maintaining Spanish residence. Ferry options from Portsmouth to Cherbourg followed by drive across France provide alternative transport. This accessibility makes Costa Blanca particularly suitable for families maintaining UK connections while establishing Spanish base."

    {
      "question": "Are there good schools near this Polop property?",
      "answer": "Yes, excellent international schools operate within 15 minutes of this property. British curriculum options provide educational continuity with UK standards, featuring familiar GCSE and A-level examination pathways. Spanish bilingual programmes offer full immersion opportunities for families seeking language acquisition alongside academic excellence. School communities are well-established with strong parent networks facilitating social integration for relocating families. Class sizes are typically smaller than UK equivalents, with pastoral care and individual attention remaining a priority. Most international schools offer trial periods allowing families to assess suitability before full commitment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Vilken hyresintäkt kan denna fastighet generera?",
      "answer": "This property typically generates €800 per week (€3,200 monthly) during peak July-August season, with shoulder months (April-June, September-October) commanding €600-700 weekly. Conservative annual projections calculate 20-25 weeks rented at average €700 weekly, generating approximately €10,000-12,000 annually, or €40,000+ at 60% annual occupancy. Short-term rental platforms (Airbnb, Vrbo) charge 15-20% commission, reducing net income accordingly. Professional property management services coordinate bookings, cleaning, and maintenance for 25-30% commission but ensure consistent occupancy. This rental potential allows families to offset property costs while maintaining personal-use flexibility."
