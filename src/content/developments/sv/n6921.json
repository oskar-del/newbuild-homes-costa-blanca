Community insurance remains prudent (€300-400 annually).

The €3,600,000 valuation, combined with documented market trends and dual-purpose investment potential, suggests meaningful long-term appreciation. Historical data indicates properties purchased five years ago have appreciated 50%+, with momentum accelerating."

      "answer": "This villa offers exceptional value against Costa Blanca North equivalents, priced at €18,000/m² versus €27,700/m² in northern regions—a 35% cost advantage. Orihuela Costa provides superior amenities including five championship golf courses (vs. one-two in the north), pristine beaches, and lower density residential construction. The property qualifies as premium-specification new-build, matching construction standards of far more expensive northern properties.
