  "areaSection": "La Romana sits in the heart of the Costa Blanca, just minutes from Alicante's amenities yet perfectly positioned in a quiet, family-oriented setting. This established area benefits from decades of development that prioritizes residential comfort over tourism congestion. The region enjoys 300 days of sunshine annually, with warm Mediterranean summers and mild winters—perfect for outdoor family activities year-round. The geography works in your favor: elevated position provides natural ventilation and protection, while proximity to both mountains and coast gives you weekend adventure options. La Romana has matured into a proper neighborhood rather than a development zone. You'll find established gardens, mature trees providing shade, and infrastructure designed for residents rather than visitors. The climate supports year-round outdoor living—morning beach trips in summer, hiking trails in autumn, and winter gardens that still flourish.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in La Romana means joining an established community where English is widely spoken and international families thrive. Your daily life revolves around genuine convenience rather than tourist infrastructure. The local Mercadona supermarket handles your weekly shopping, while weekly markets provide fresh produce and community connection. Schools are genuinely integrated into family life here—not afterthoughts. International options with British curriculum mean your children continue their education seamlessly. Healthcare feels less daunting when you know private clinics employ English-speaking doctors and the regional hospital is a comfortable 30-minute drive. Weekends naturally flow toward the beach—multiple Blue Flag beaches within 20 minutes offer clean water and proper facilities. Many families discover golf becomes part of their routine, with championship courses nearby. The expat community means you're never isolated figuring out Spanish bureaucracy; established residents mentor newcomers through residency, healthcare registration, and schooling options. Restaurants serve everything from Spanish home cooking to familiar cuisines. Children make friends quickly in neighborhoods where international families cluster. Evening paseos (walks) become family tradition in this walkable area.",
  "investmentSection": "La Romana property values have increased 8% year-on-year, reflecting growing international interest and established neighborhood appeal. This villa at €360,000 sits 22% above the area average of €2,200 per square meter—justified by premium specifications and desirable location. Rental potential matters for many families: similar properties in Villas de la Romana command approximately €800 per week during summer season, generating €35,000-€40,000 annually if you choose short-term lets. Even conservative long-term rental of €1,200-€1,400 monthly provides 4-5% annual returns. Your investment gains from established infrastructure (no development risk), international demand (families seeking EU homes post-Brexit), and coastal proximity without beachfront prices. The 40% discount compared to Spanish islands (Balearics, Canaries) makes this especially compelling for families wanting investment security rather than speculation.",
  "conclusion": "This villa represents exactly what families seek: genuine space to grow, community values, excellent value, and a proven neighborhood where international families thrive. At €360,000, you're investing in more than property—you're investing in lifestyle improvements, capital appreciation, and family memories. The 3 bedrooms give your children their own space. The 544-square-meter plot provides safe outdoor freedom. The established neighborhood means you're joining proven community infrastructure, not pioneering unknown territory. The 40% discount versus island markets protects your investment while generating rental income potential. La Romana's school options, healthcare access, and international community mean relocation anxiety dissolves quickly. Your family will adapt faster than you expect—within months, Mediterranean sunshine, beach weekends, and Spanish lifestyle become wonderfully normal.

    },
    {

Interest rates run 3-4% for EU citizens, sometimes slightly higher for non-EU. You'll need: property valuation, proof of income (employment letter or pension statement), identification, and NIE. British pension income qualifies perfectly. The process takes 4-6 weeks. Many families combine savings with modest mortgages for optimal cash flow."
    },

You'll genuinely reduce heating costs and increase outdoor living."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do international families thrive in La Romana?",

Many families report stronger community bonds here than in their home countries."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the rental income potential for this villa?",
      "answer": "Summer weekly rentals typically generate €800-€900 per week (€35,000-€40,000 annually during peak season).
