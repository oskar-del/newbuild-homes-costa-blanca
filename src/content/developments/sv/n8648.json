  "areaSection": "Polop occupies a distinctive position in the Alicante landscape, perched strategically between the Mediterranean coast and the dramatic Serra de Aitana mountains. This geographical positioning delivers the exceptional climate that defines the region—over 320 days of sunshine annually, with mild winters rarely dipping below 10°C and pleasant summers moderated by coastal breezes.\n\nThe municipality has carefully preserved its character while welcoming international residents, maintaining authentic Spanish architecture within its historic center while developing modern residential zones. The elevation provides natural advantages: cooler temperatures in summer, reduced humidity levels, and panoramic vistas across the surrounding valleys. Polop's location places buyers equidistant from major urban centers and unspoiled natural landscapes, creating an ideal equilibrium for those seeking Mediterranean living without the intensity of larger coastal developments.",

Rental yield potential remains substantial: comparable properties achieve €800 for typical 7-night lets, generating meaningful returns for investors seeking income alongside capital appreciation. The combination of growing international demand, limited new supply, and established infrastructure creates favorable conditions for long-term value growth.
