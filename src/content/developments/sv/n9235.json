      "question": "Är Costa Blanca en bra plats att köpa fastighet?",

The region combines affordability with quality of life, established expatriate communities, and strong market fundamentals including 8% year-on-year growth. San Pedro del Pinatar specifically has become increasingly attractive as families seek alternatives to overcrowded coastal towns, offering genuine community living without tourist overwhelm."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlänningar köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners can freely purchase property in Spain without restrictions or special permissions. EU citizens, UK citizens, and international buyers have equal property ownership rights. Most foreign buyers secure Spanish mortgages or use savings; legal processes are straightforward when working with qualified Spanish solicitors. Non-resident buyers should understand tax implications and register with Spanish tax authorities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Vilka är kostnaderna för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, budget approximately 10-12% in additional costs: property transfer tax (6-8%), notary fees (0.5-1%), property registry fees (0.3-0.5%), and solicitor costs (0.5-1%). Stamp duty, VAT on new builds, or plusvalía (capital gains tax) may apply depending on circumstances. Ongoing costs include local property tax (IBI), typically €200-400 annually for properties like this villa, plus utilities and community fees if applicable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Behöver jag visum för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "No, purchasing property doesn't require a visa. However, you may need appropriate visa status to live in Spain long-term. UK citizens can stay visa-free for 90 days; longer stays typically require residency permits. Property ownership is separate from residency rights—you can own Spanish property while residing elsewhere. Consult UK or Spanish consulates regarding your specific residency intentions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jag få ett bolån i Spanien som utlänning?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers regularly obtain Spanish mortgages. Spanish banks offer 20-80% financing on property purchases, with competitive rates often below UK equivalents. Most require proof of income, employment contracts, and tax returns. As a foreigner, you'll typically need a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and may face slightly stricter lending criteria than Spanish residents. Working with a mortgage broker familiar with international buyers simplifies the process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur är levnadskostnaderna på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca cost of living is approximately 20-30% lower than comparable UK areas. Groceries, dining out, utilities, and healthcare are significantly cheaper. A family budget of €1,500-2,000 monthly covers comfortable living including rent/mortgage, utilities, food, and entertainment. Property ownership costs are minimal (€200-400 IBI annually for this property), and services like healthcare are far more affordable than UK private alternatives."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur är vädret på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys over 300 days of annual sunshine with Mediterranean climate characteristics. Summers (June-September) are warm to hot (28-35°C), winters mild (10-15°C) with occasional rain. Spring and autumn are perfect outdoor weather (18-25°C). This climate enables year-round outdoor activities and reduces heating/cooling costs. Families appreciate the consistent weather, though summer heat occasionally requires inland retreat or beach visits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur långt är det från Sverige till Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Alicante-Elche Airport, serving San Pedro del Pinatar, is 45 minutes away and offers numerous direct flights to UK cities (London, Manchester, Birmingham, etc.). Flight time is approximately 2-2.5 hours. Multiple airlines compete on this route, making regular UK visits affordable. Many expat families maintain this connection, visiting family 3-4 times yearly or more. The distance feels manageable rather than prohibitive."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this villa suitable for families with young children?",
      "answer": "Yes, this villa is ideal for families with young children. Three bedrooms accommodate growing families; three bathrooms eliminate morning conflicts.
