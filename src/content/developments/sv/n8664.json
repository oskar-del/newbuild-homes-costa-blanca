The surrounding landscape is characterized by rolling hills and agricultural heritage, giving the area a peaceful, grounded feel.

    },
    {
      "question": "Är Costa Blanca en bra plats att köpa fastighet?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlänningar köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Foreigners enjoy equal property ownership rights as Spanish citizens. The process requires NIE (tax identification number), which is straightforward to obtain. Most international buyers work with English-speaking Spanish solicitors who handle all legal documentation. No residency requirement exists—you can own property as a non-resident. Many UK and European families have successfully purchased Spanish property without complications."
    },
    {
      "question": "Vilka är kostnaderna för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Beyond purchase price, expect approximately 10-12% in combined costs: 6% transfer tax, 1-1.5% notary and registration fees, plus legal and surveyor costs. Ongoing annual costs include approximately 0.4-0.6% property tax (IBI) and optional community fees if applicable. This villa's €375,000 price would involve roughly €40,000-45,000 total acquisition costs. Financing through Spanish mortgages is available to foreigners with 70-80% loan-to-value ratios."
    },

      "question": "Hur är levnadskostnaderna på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca's cost of living is 25-35% lower than UK equivalents, particularly for utilities, healthcare, and food. Lorca specifically is more affordable than coastal tourist areas. This villa's running costs would be modest: electricity €80-120 monthly (modest compared to UK), water €15-25, property tax approximately €150-200 annually. Healthcare for private insurance is €40-80 monthly per person. Families typically budget €2,500-3,500 monthly for comfortable living including school fees."
    },
    {
      "question": "Är Costa Blanca bra för pensionärer?",
      "answer": "Excellent choice for retirees. Warm climate reduces heating costs, healthcare is outstanding at fraction of UK prices, and cost of living is significantly lower. Established international communities provide social networks and English language support. However, Lorca's family-focused community with schools and younger population creates particularly vibrant, active environment compared to purely retirement-oriented coastal areas. Retirees benefit from affordable living while remaining engaged with community life."
    },
    {
      "question": "How far is Costa Blanca from UK?",
      "answer": "Approximately 1,000 miles (1,600km) with flight times around 2.5-3 hours from most UK airports to Alicante. Regular direct flights operate from London, Manchester, Birmingham and other major UK airports. This villa in Lorca is 90 minutes from Alicante Airport, making frequent family visits between UK and Spain very manageable. Many international property owners maintain UK presence while spending extended periods in Spain."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur är vädret på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Mediterranean climate with 300+ sunny days annually. Summers reach 28-32°C (warm but not extreme like coastal areas), winters remain mild at 12-16°C with occasional frost inland. Lorca's elevation (480m above sea level) provides cooler summers than coastal zones—perfect for families avoiding extreme heat. Rainfall is minimal (300-400mm annually), concentrated in autumn/spring. Spring and autumn offer ideal conditions for outdoor family activities."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many bedrooms does this villa have?",
      "answer": "3 spacious bedrooms plus 2 full bathrooms in 112m² of living space. The layout provides flexibility for families: master bedroom, two additional bedrooms suitable for children or guest accommodation, plus separate utility areas. The generous 532m² plot enables future expansion if needed. All bedrooms benefit from natural light and ventilation through modern windows."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I rent this villa to offset ownership costs?",
      "answer": "Yes, excellent rental potential exists. Similar 3-bedroom villas in Lorca achieve approximately €800 per week during peak season (June-September), with 6-8 weeks typical annual rental. This generates €5,000-6,500 annually from peak season alone. Shoulder seasons (April-May, October) achieve €500-600 weekly. International families seeking authentic Spanish experiences represent strong demand. Many owners successfully offset 30-50% of annual holding costs through casual rental income."
