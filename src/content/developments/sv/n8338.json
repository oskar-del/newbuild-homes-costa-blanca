      "question": "Är Costa Blanca en bra plats att köpa fastighet?",
      "answer": "Ja, Costa Blanca är en utmärkt property acquisition destination for international buyers. The region demonstrates consistent 8% year-on-year price appreciation, established expatriate communities with English prevalence, comprehensive healthcare and education infrastructure, and exceptional beach accessibility.

    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlänningar köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign nationals possess unrestricted rights to purchase Spanish property without citizenship requirements. The process involves obtaining a Spanish tax identification number (NIE), securing mortgage financing if required, and engaging qualified legal representation for conveyancing. Most foreign purchasers complete acquisitions within 6-8 weeks. UK and EU nationals face identical procedural requirements post-Brexit. Professional advisors experienced in international transactions streamline documentation and regulatory compliance significantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Vilka är kostnaderna för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Spanish property acquisition involves acquisition costs approximately 10-12% of purchase price, comprising transfer tax (6-8% depending on region), legal fees (1-2%), notary charges (0.5-1%), and agency commissions typically 3-5%. This property priced €1,095,000 would incur approximately €109,500-€131,400 in total acquisition costs. Purchasers should budget for utility connection costs, property surveys (optional but recommended), and mortgage arrangement fees if applicable.

    },
    {
      "question": "Behöver jag visum för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Property ownership does not require Spanish residency or specific visa classification. Non-resident foreign purchasers may acquire property purely for investment purposes without establishing residency status. However, some buyers elect golden visa applications (€500,000 minimum property investment) providing residency benefits. Residency establishment involves separate visa applications unrelated to property acquisition. UK nationals currently require standard visa processing; EU nationals retain simplified access. Property ownership represents distinct legal pathway from immigration status."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur mycket är fastighetsskatten i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Spanish annual property taxes (Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles) average 0.4-0.7% of cadastral value, which typically represents 30-50% of actual market value. This property valued €1,095,000 might incur annual taxes of €2,000-€4,000 depending on cadastral assessment. Additionally, non-resident owners pay wealth tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio) on aggregate Spanish asset values exceeding €600,000 at rates starting 0.2% and escalating to 3.75%. Residents benefit from wealth tax exemptions on primary residences. Professional tax advisors optimise liability structures for individual circumstances."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jag få ett bolån i Spanien som utlänning?",
      "answer": "Yes, Spanish mortgage providers offer financing to qualified foreign purchasers, though terms and availability vary. Typical foreign buyer mortgages provide 70-80% loan-to-value ratios with interest rates currently 3.5-5% depending on bank and economic conditions. Documentation requirements include income verification, credit history assessment, and financial stability demonstration. UK and EU nationals access competitive rates; non-EU purchasers may face marginally restrictive terms. Spanish mortgage brokers specialising in international transactions facilitate applications significantly, securing optimal rate terms and streamlined approval processes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the cost of living in Torre Pacheco?",
      "answer": "Torre Pacheco offers moderate cost of living substantially below northern European comparables.
