      "answer": "€349,000. This represents €2,983/m² of built space—a premium price for Calasparra reflecting high-quality construction, but 40% cheaper than comparable properties on Spanish islands like Mallorca or the Costa del Sol.

    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlänningar köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Non-EU and EU citizens have equal property purchase rights in Spain. No residency visa is required to buy property—you obtain a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and proceed through standard conveyancing. Many UK families complete purchases within 4-8 weeks. Legal representation (abogado) is essential and relatively inexpensive (€1,000-1,500 typical)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Vilka är kostnaderna för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect approximately 8-10% additional costs: transfer tax (6-7%), legal fees (1-1.5%), property registry (0.5%), and surveyor (€400-600). A €349,000 purchase typically incurs €28,000-35,000 total transaction costs. Budgeting transparently prevents surprises and allows proper financial planning for families."
    },
    {
      "question": "Är Costa Blanca en bra plats att köpa fastighet?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca is excellent for family property investment, particularly Calasparra. The region offers established infrastructure, reliable healthcare, international schools, and consistent 8% annual appreciation. Unlike oversaturated tourist areas, Calasparra maintains authentic community character while providing modern amenities. It's ideal for families, remote workers, and retirees seeking balanced Mediterranean living."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the cost of living in Calasparra?",

Groceries average 30-40% less than UK prices; utilities €60-100 monthly for a family home; restaurant meals €8-15 for quality dining; fuel approximately €1.30/liter. Annual living costs for a family typically range €15,000-20,000 excluding mortgage—substantially less than comparable UK regions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Behöver jag visum för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically to purchase property. However, residency status differs from purchase rights. Non-EU citizens buying property can apply for residency visas (Golden Visa programs exist for significant investments). EU/UK citizens post-Brexit can purchase freely but should clarify residency intentions separately. Legal advisors clarify all immigration implications during purchase process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jag få ett bolån i Spanien som utlänning?",
      "answer": "Yes. Spanish banks readily provide mortgages to foreign buyers with 70-80% loan-to-value ratios. Interest rates are competitive (currently 3-4% fixed). You'll require Spanish tax identification (NIE), proof of income, and credit verification. Many UK buyers successfully secure Spanish mortgages; some combine Spanish financing with UK equity release. Mortgage brokers specializing in expatriate financing simplify the process significantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur är vädret på Costa Blanca?",
      "answer": "Excellent year-round. Over 300 days of sunshine annually. Summers (June-September) reach 28-32°C with low humidity; winters remain mild (10-15°C average) with occasional rain but rarely below freezing. Spring and autumn are perfect with 18-22°C temperatures. The Mediterranean climate supports active outdoor living, gardening, and beach activities throughout the year—ideal for families enjoying outdoor lifestyles."
    },
    {
      "question": "How close is this property to international schools?",
      "answer": "The International British School of Murcia is 22 minutes away, providing British curriculum education essential for UK families. Multiple alternative international schools operate within 20-30 minutes offering French, German, and other curricula. Spanish public schools are also excellent quality. Proximity to quality education options makes this location ideal for families with school-age children prioritizing consistent international standards."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Calasparra better value than coastal tourist towns?",
      "answer": "Calasparra maintains authentic Spanish character without excessive tourist infrastructure costs. Properties cost 40% less than beachfront areas, yet quality, amenities, and appreciation potential remain equivalent. You're purchasing lifestyle rather than tourist location premiums. Families gain Mediterranean living, safe communities, and investment growth without paying for proximity to nightlife districts or holiday rental saturation found in major tourist zones."
