  "heroIntro": "Located in the vibrant heart of Torrevieja, this modern 2-bedroom apartment represents the perfect balance between beachside living and urban convenience. Situated in an exclusive boutique development of just 8 units, this 59m² home captures everything that makes Costa Blanca living desirable. At merely 600 meters from Playa de Los Locos and 650 meters from the animated Playa del Cura promenade, you're steps away from some of Torrevieja's most popular beaches without the chaos of beachfront development.\n\nTorrevieja has evolved into a thriving Mediterranean destination known for its salt lakes, vibrant cultural calendar, and welcoming community of both Spanish residents and international expats. This central location puts you in the pulse of the action—morning coffee at a local café, afternoon beach walks, and evening tapas without needing a car for daily activities. The apartment's smart layout maximizes the 59m² space efficiently, offering two separate bedrooms and two full bathrooms, making it equally suitable as a primary residence or holiday rental investment.\n\nThe new build quality means modern construction standards, contemporary finishes, and the peace of mind that comes with a property built to current specifications. This development represents a rare opportunity to invest in central Torrevieja real estate in a small, select community rather than a sprawling complex.",
