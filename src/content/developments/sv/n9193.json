    },
    {
      "question": "Kan utlänningar köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers have identical property rights as Spanish citizens. No restrictions exist on property purchase, though you'll need a Spanish NIE (identification number) and must declare funds origins for Anti-Money Laundering purposes. EU and non-EU citizens follow identical procedures. A Spanish property lawyer handles documentation—a standard expense of 1-2% of purchase price."
    },
    {
      "question": "Vilka är kostnaderna för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",

Mortgage arrangement adds 0.5-1% if financing. Annual costs include property tax (0.4-1.1% of value), IBI (municipal property tax, approximately €300-600 annually), and insurance (€200-400 yearly for buildings insurance)."

    },
    {
      "question": "Behöver jag visum för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "No visa is required specifically to purchase property. However, if you're non-EU and planning extended residence, you'll need residency documentation. EU/UK citizens (post-Brexit) can establish residency by obtaining Spanish property, opening local bank accounts, and registering with local authorities. Many property buyers work with immigration specialists to understand residency options relevant to their nationality and intended stay duration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hur mycket är fastighetsskatten i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Årliga fastighetsskatter in Murcia include IBI (municipal property tax, approximately €300-600 yearly depending on location and value) plus regional wealth tax if applicable (€0-3,000+ annually depending on total property value and residency status). Owner-occupied properties receive tax relief in many regions. Rental properties generate income tax obligations (19-45% depending on income bracket). A Spanish accountant can explain obligations specific to your situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kan jag få ett bolån i Spanien som utlänning?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers can obtain Spanish mortgages. Most Spanish banks require 30% deposit (sometimes negotiable to 20% for well-qualified buyers) with loan-to-value ratios around 70%. Interest rates typically track Spanish bank rates (currently 3-5% for variable mortgages). Non-resident buyers may face stricter requirements and slightly higher rates. Many buyers also explore UK mortgage portability—carrying existing UK mortgages to Spanish properties. Professional mortgage brokers familiar with cross-border transactions simplify the process."
    },

Many owners use properties personally during preferred months, renting remaining periods for income diversification."
    },
    {
