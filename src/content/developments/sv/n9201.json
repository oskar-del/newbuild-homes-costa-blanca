  "metaDescription": "Modern 2-bedroom penthouse in Torrevieja, 250m from Playa del Cura. Prime beachfront location, exclusive development of 12 apartments. Ref: N9201",
  "heroIntro": "This exceptional 2-bedroom penthouse (Reference N9201) represents a rare opportunity to own a modern residence in one of Costa Blanca's most sought-after beachfront developments. Situated in the heart of Torrevieja, just 250 meters from the golden sands of Playa del Cura, this 69m² property combines contemporary design with the authentic Mediterranean lifestyle that makes the Costa Blanca so desirable.\n\nTorrevieja has transformed into a vibrant coastal destination, moving beyond its traditional salt industry heritage to become a modern hub for expats, families, and investors seeking year-round sunshine and authentic Spanish beach culture. The town maintains a refreshing balance—large enough to offer excellent amenities, restaurants, and services, yet small enough to preserve genuine Spanish charm. This penthouse sits within an exclusive development of just 12 carefully designed apartments, ensuring an intimate community atmosphere rather than an impersonal complex.\n\nThe proximity to Playa del Cura—one of Torrevieja's most beloved beaches—cannot be overstated. This beach is known for its clean, soft sand, excellent water quality, and family-friendly facilities. From your penthouse, you're steps away from beach bars serving fresh seafood, water sports facilities, and the leisurely Mediterranean lifestyle that attracts thousands of visitors annually.",
  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's real estate market presents compelling opportunities for investors seeking reliable returns and lifestyle benefits.

Additionally, Spain's residency options for property investors and the favorable tax environment for property owners create a supportive investment climate. Properties in established beachfront locations like this rarely become available, making this opportunity particularly noteworthy for those seeking both investment returns and personal enjoyment.",
