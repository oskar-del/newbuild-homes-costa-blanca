    },
    {
      "question": "Är Costa Blanca en bra plats att köpa fastighet?",

Currency advantages favour UK buyers, and the established expat infrastructure provides familiar support systems. Long-term value and lifestyle benefits combine to make Costa Blanca property ownership increasingly popular among discerning families."
    },
    {
      "question": "Vilka är kostnaderna för att köpa fastighet i Spanien?",
      "answer": "Beyond the €449,500 purchase price, expect: transfer tax (6-8%), notary and registration fees (approximately 1%), and professional legal advice (typically €800-1,500). Total acquisition costs usually total 8-10% of purchase price. Ongoing costs include annual property tax (modest rates), community fees (varies by area), and utilities. These costs remain significantly lower than equivalent UK property purchases, making Spanish ownership highly cost-effective."

    {

These economics make Mediterranean family living genuinely affordable without lifestyle compromise."

The established expat community provides excellent guidance on school selection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this property suitable for rental income?",
      "answer": "Yes, highly suitable. Properties in Golf La Marquesa communities typically achieve €800+ weekly rental income during peak seasons, with strong demand from golf tourists and holiday families. The 3-bedroom layout appeals to family holiday lettings. Many owners combine personal use with rental periods, generating meaningful income while enjoying the property.
