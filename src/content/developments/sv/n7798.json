Located approximately 50km south of Alicante airport, this established community has evolved from a traditional fishing village into a modern, family-oriented destination. The town benefits from a Mediterranean climate with 320+ days of sunshine annually, mild winters (rarely below 10°C), and warm, dry summers. Unlike some coastal overdevelopments, San Pedro del Pinatar maintains authentic Spanish character while offering world-class facilities. The natural Mar Menor lagoon provides unique ecological importance and stunning scenery, while the town's strategic location offers easy access to both urban amenities and pristine beaches. The real estate market has experienced consistent growth (+8% year-on-year), reflecting increasing recognition of the area's value and livability.",
