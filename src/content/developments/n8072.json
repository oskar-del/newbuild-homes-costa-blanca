  "areaSection": "Aguilas is a coastal municipality in Murcia's eastern edge, positioned between the dramatic appeal of northern Costa Blanca and the quieter charm of southern Mediterranean Spain. The town sits at the meeting point of the Levantine and Baetic regions, creating unique geographical advantages: protection from excessive heat through sea breezes and accessibility to both urban amenities and natural landscapes. The climate here is Mediterranean with average temperatures between 12°C (winter) and 28°C (summer), with over 300 days of annual sunshine.\n\nThe area's development trajectory has been measured compared to overtouristed coastal centers. This controlled growth means infrastructure remains modern without the congestion of major tourist hubs. The local economy balances traditional fishing heritage with sustainable tourism development, creating stable market conditions for property investors.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Aguilas means joining an established international community where English is widely spoken and expatriate support networks are well-developed. Daily life centers around Mediterranean rhythms: morning paseos along the promenade, afternoon siestas, and evening social gatherings at local chiringuitos (beach bars). The town offers authentic Spanish experiences without overwhelming tourism—farmers' markets operate several times weekly, local restaurants serve regional specialties at accessible prices, and the pace of life encourages genuine community connections.\n\nFor investors managing holiday rentals, the infrastructure is practical: reliable utilities, good internet connectivity, and English-speaking property management services are available. The beach proximity means year-round appeal—summer holidays from northern Europe, winter escapes for retirees, and shoulder-season long weekends create multiple rental market segments. Healthcare access is straightforward with English-speaking doctors available, and major shopping (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum) meets all daily needs without the complexity of larger urban areas.",
