    },
    {
      "question": "Могут ли иностранцы купить недвижимость в Испании?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Foreigners can purchase property in Spain without restrictions, including British nationals. The process is straightforward: obtain a Spanish tax ID number (NIE), have a lawyer review the purchase agreement, arrange financing if needed, and complete the property registration. No visa is required specifically for property purchase, and many international buyers successfully navigate the process with professional guidance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Каковы расходы на покупку недвижимости в Испании?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect approximately 10-12% in additional costs including: property transfer tax (6-8%), notary fees (0.5-1%), land registry fees (0.5%), and legal fees (1-2%). For a €345,000 property, total acquisition costs would be roughly €35,000-€41,000 additional. These costs are predictable and clearly itemized.

    },
    {
      "question": "Является ли Коста-Бланка хорошим местом для покупки недвижимости?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Costa Blanca is an excellent property market, particularly for families. The region offers year-round sunshine (320+ days annually), affordable cost of living compared to northern Europe, excellent healthcare and international schools, and proven property market appreciation (8% year-on-year in this area). The established expat community means strong support networks for relocated families, while the genuine Spanish character prevents it from feeling like an isolated expatriate enclave."
    },
    {
      "question": "Какова стоимость жизни на Коста-Бланке?",
      "answer": "Cost of living in Costa Blanca is significantly lower than the UK—typically 25-35% less expensive depending on your lifestyle choices. Groceries at supermarkets like Mercadona offer exceptional value, dining out remains affordable, and utilities cost considerably less. For families, this means school fees, activities, and holidays stretch further. €1,200-€1,500 monthly covers comfortable living expenses for a couple beyond mortgage/rent, while families typically budget €1,800-€2,500 depending on choices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Как далеко Коста-Бланка от России?",

The time zone difference is just one hour (Spain is UTC+1 in winter, UTC+2 in summer), eliminating jet lag challenges for UK family visits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Какая погода на Коста-Бланке?",
      "answer": "Costa Blanca enjoys outstanding year-round weather with over 320 days of sunshine annually. Summers (June-September) are warm and dry, averaging 28-32°C.

This consistent, moderate climate is perfect for families wanting Mediterranean living without extreme heat, supporting outdoor activities throughout the year."
    },
    {
      "question": "Могу ли я получить ипотеку в Испании как иностранец?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers can obtain Spanish mortgages, though terms differ from UK lending. Spanish lenders typically offer 70-80% loan-to-value financing to foreign buyers, compared to 95% for Spanish residents. Interest rates are competitive, often lower than UK rates. Lenders require proof of income, employment contracts, and credit history. Working with a mortgage advisor familiar with international buyers simplifies the process. Many families combine Spanish mortgage with UK savings for larger deposits, resulting in favorable borrowing terms."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is La Romana good for families relocating from the UK?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. La Romana is specifically popular with UK families for several reasons: established English-speaking community providing support networks, British curriculum international schools nearby, safe residential neighborhoods with low traffic, excellent healthcare with English-speaking doctors, and cost of living allowing families to maintain higher quality of life than in the UK. The relaxed Mediterranean pace supports family time, while modern amenities ensure you're not sacrificing convenience for lifestyle. Many families describe it as having 'found their people' within the expat community here."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the rental income potential for this villa?",
      "answer": "Similar properties in La Romana command approximately €800 per week during peak summer months (June-September), potentially generating €12,000-€15,000 per season. Off-season (October-May) typically attracts €400-€600 weekly rates. With professional property management, an owner might achieve €12,000-€18,000 annual rental income after management fees and operating costs. This provides realistic returns while maintaining the property as your family's Mediterranean home during your own vacation periods. Many families find this rental income offset property costs substantially."
