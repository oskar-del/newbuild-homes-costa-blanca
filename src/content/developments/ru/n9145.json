  "metaDescription": "Modern 2-bedroom apartment in Torrevieja centre, 200m from beach. New build, 64m². Perfect beachside living with urban convenience.",
  "heroIntro": "Experience contemporary coastal living in the heart of Torrevieja with this stunning 2-bedroom apartment in an exclusive boutique development. Located just 200 meters from the Mediterranean Sea, this newly constructed property offers the perfect balance between beach accessibility and vibrant city center amenities. With only 8 apartments in the development, this is not mass-produced housing but rather a carefully curated collection of modern homes designed for discerning buyers seeking quality and location.\n\nTorrevieja has transformed significantly over the past decade, evolving from a traditional fishing town into a cosmopolitan Mediterranean destination while retaining its authentic Spanish charm. This apartment sits at the intersection of that evolution, offering modern finishes and smart layouts in a building that respects the surrounding urban landscape. The centro location means you're walking distance to restaurants, shops, and the promenade without the isolation of outlying developments.\n\nBuilt to contemporary standards with efficient use of space, the 64m² layout maximizes functionality and light. Whether you're seeking a permanent residence, a holiday retreat, or an investment property in one of Spain's most dynamic coastal markets, this apartment represents a genuine opportunity in an increasingly sought-after neighborhood.",
  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja has established itself as one of Spain's most resilient and growth-oriented coastal markets, with consistent demand from both European expats and Spanish nationals seeking second homes or investment properties. The centro location is particularly advantageous for rental potential, as tourist rentals command premium rates due to beach proximity and walkable amenities. Properties in this neighborhood benefit from strong seasonal tourism (July-September peaks, but increasing year-round appeal) and a growing permanent resident base seeking central locations.\n\nThe boutique nature of this 8-apartment development distinguishes it from larger complexes, potentially resulting in better maintenance standards and more selective resident composition. Smaller developments often appreciate better than mass-market urbanizations, and the scarcity value of limited units can work in your favor for both resale and rental income. With Torrevieja attracting 4+ million tourists annually and increasing residential investment, purchasing in the centro represents positioning yourself in one of the Costa Blanca's most dynamic micro-markets.",
