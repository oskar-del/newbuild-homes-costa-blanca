  "heroIntro": "Welcome to El Raso, Guardamar del Segura—a peaceful coastal haven where retirement living combines genuine relaxation with practical convenience. This exceptional 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment offers the perfect base for a fulfilling retirement on Spain's Costa Blanca, priced at €279,000 with premium specification at just €2,762/m²—remarkably, 50% less than comparable properties in nearby Jávea.\n\nGuardaramar del Segura has become increasingly popular with retirees seeking a slower pace of life without sacrificing access to excellent healthcare, international amenities, and a welcoming expat community. Unlike some overly developed Costa Blanca towns, Guardamar maintains a more authentically Spanish character while offering everything you need for comfortable, easy living.

  "areaSection": "Guardamar del Segura is a charming coastal town in the south of Alicante province, where the Segura River meets the Mediterranean. Unlike the busier resort towns nearby, Guardamar maintains a relaxed, authentically Spanish atmosphere with modern amenities and excellent infrastructure. The town sits 40km south of Alicante city and just 15km north of Torrevieja, giving you proximity to larger services while preserving a peaceful environment. With a year-round Mediterranean climate, dramatic sand dunes protected as a nature reserve, and a beautifully maintained promenade, Guardamar offers the perfect blend of nature, culture, and convenience. The expanding international community—particularly British and Northern European residents—has created a welcoming, multi-cultural social environment without the overcrowded feel of larger Costa Blanca resorts.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Guardamar del Segura revolves around the relaxed Mediterranean rhythm. Mornings might start with a walk along Playa Centro, the town's award-winning Blue Flag beach, followed by coffee at a beachfront chiringuito where you'll likely encounter familiar faces from the expat community. Wednesday's bustling weekly market offers fresh local produce, seafood, and Spanish delicacies, while supermarkets like Mercadona and Lidl provide everything else you need. Healthcare is genuinely convenient—the Centro de Salud Guardamar operates alongside private clinics, and the Hospital de Torrevieja is just 15 minutes away with excellent English-speaking staff. For leisure, you're spoiled: two championship golf courses are 10-15 minutes away, restaurants range from traditional Spanish paella to international cuisine, and the dune-backed beaches of La Roqueta and Les Ortigues offer quieter alternatives. The expat community is active but not overwhelming, with social clubs, language exchanges, and regular gatherings that help newcomers settle in quickly.",
  "investmentSection": "Property values in Guardamar del Segura have increased 7% year-on-year, demonstrating solid market confidence.

      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. EU and non-EU nationals have equal property purchase rights in Spain.

    },
    {
      "question": "Каковы расходы на покупку недвижимости в Испании?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Могу ли я получить ипотеку в Испании как иностранец?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers frequently obtain Spanish mortgages. Most banks lend to non-resident foreigners at competitive rates (currently 2.5-3.5% for fixed-rate mortgages). Typically you need a 30-50% deposit, proof of income (pension statements work), and a Spanish tax identification number (NIE). English-speaking mortgage brokers simplify the application process. Many retirees find the rates more attractive than borrowing in their home countries."
    },

Rain averages just 300mm yearly, concentrated in autumn and spring. This consistent, mild climate supports outdoor living, beach activities, and golf year-round. Winter temperatures rarely drop below 10°C, eliminating the heating costs common in Northern Europe."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I rent out this property if I don't use it full-time?",
      "answer": "Yes, many owners successfully let their properties to holiday visitors. Typical 7-night rentals in Guardamar achieve €700, potentially generating €15,000-20,000 annually from summer lettings alone. Holiday rental platforms (Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com) make marketing easy. You'll need Spanish tax identification (NIE) and must register rental income with Spanish tax authorities, though property managers can handle all administration."
