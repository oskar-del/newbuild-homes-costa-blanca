  "areaSection": "Cartagena represents one of Spain's most underrated coastal destinations, blessed with a temperate Mediterranean climate that delivers 300+ days of annual sunshine. Situated in Murcia's southeastern coastline, this ancient Roman port city combines historical significance with modern amenities.

The region benefits from dramatic coastal geography, with sheltered coves and Blue Flag beaches within minutes of residential areas. Cartagena's strategic location provides proximity to both Murcia's cultural attractions and the broader Costa Blanca's leisure offerings.
