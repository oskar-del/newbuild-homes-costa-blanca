  "areaSection": "Javea, known locally as Xàbia, is a prestigious coastal municipality situated on the Costa Blanca, approximately 100 kilometers south of Valencia. The town is distinguished by its dramatic geography—characterized by three distinctive headlands (Cabo de San Antonio, Punta Negra, and Cabo de la Nao) that create intimate coves and protected beaches along its 24-kilometer coastline. The Mediterranean climate delivers 320 days of annual sunshine, with warm summers (25-28°C) and mild winters (10-12°C), providing year-round appeal for those seeking permanent residence or seasonal retreats. The inland mountain terrain offers natural protection from excessive heat while maintaining the health benefits of coastal living. Javea's population of approximately 27,000 maintains an exclusive character compared to overcrowded coastal alternatives, with considerable space between developed areas and pristine natural reserves. The Montgó Nature Reserve dominates the inland landscape, offering hiking trails, biodiversity, and genuine separation from mass tourism.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Life in Javea embodies sophisticated Mediterranean living with decidedly cosmopolitan character. The town hosts a thriving international community—predominantly British, German, and Dutch residents—who have established excellent English-language infrastructure, professional services, and cultural institutions. The weekly Farmer's Market brings seasonal produce directly from local agricultural regions, while British Corner Shop and numerous international supermarkets cater to specific preferences. Dining options range from traditional Valencian beachfront restaurants serving fresh paella and seafood to contemporary European establishments catering to refined palates. The town's three principal beaches—Arenal (Blue Flag designation, golden sand), La Grava (charming pebbly cove), and numerous smaller calas—provide diverse leisure options for swimming, paddleboarding, and waterfront dining. The established golf community centers around Jávea Golf Club (9 holes, walking distance for many properties), complemented by championship courses at La Sella and Oliva Nova within 15-25 minutes. Healthcare is comprehensively addressed through multiple English-speaking medical professionals, international hospitals within 15-30 minutes, and a well-established private clinic network. The expat infrastructure means professional services—accountants, legal advisors, property managers—routinely accommodate international clients with fluent English service.",
