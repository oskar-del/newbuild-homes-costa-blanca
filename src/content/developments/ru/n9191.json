    },
    {
      "question": "Могут ли иностранцы купить недвижимость в Испании?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Foreign nationals enjoy unrestricted property acquisition rights in Spain matching Spanish citizens. UK, EU, and non-EU buyers complete identical purchasing processes through Spanish notaries. No visa requirement exists for property purchase alone, though Spanish residency opens additional planning advantages. Legal representation through English-speaking Spanish solicitors streamlines documentation and regulatory compliance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Каковы расходы на покупку недвижимости в Испании?",
      "answer": "Beyond purchase price, expect acquisition costs totaling 7-10% of property value. Transfer tax (IVT) represents 3-5% depending on regional classification and buyer residency status. Notary fees, legal representation, and registration costs total approximately 2-3%. Annual property tax (IBI) averages €200-400 for properties in Los Alcazares. Community fees in Serena Golf typically €150-200 monthly covering maintenance, security, and shared amenities. Mortgage-associated costs (if applicable) include bank fees and valuation charges."
    },
    {
      "question": "Является ли Коста-Бланка хорошим местом для покупки недвижимости?",
      "answer": "Definitively yes for specific buyer profiles. The region demonstrates 8% year-on-year appreciation with established international infrastructure, healthcare access, and lifestyle amenities. Los Alcazares specifically appeals to discerning buyers seeking alternative to over-developed Torrevieja or Benidorm while maintaining accessibility and community. Investment returns through rental income (€800+/week for 3-bed villas) exceed typical European real estate yields. Mediterranean climate, golf courses, and beaches create consistent demand from Northern European retirees and professionals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Какова стоимость жизни на Коста-Бланке?",
      "answer": "Monthly expenses for comfortable lifestyle run €1,200-1,800 depending on choices. Groceries cost approximately 20-30% less than UK or Northern Europe through supermarket chains. Utilities (electricity, water, gas) average €100-150 monthly, though air conditioning increases summer costs. Dining ranges from €8-12 casual restaurants to €25-40 fine dining establishments. Healthcare costs minimal for residents with Spanish coverage or private insurance (€80-150/month). Entertainment through golf (€40-60 per round) and beach activities involves discretionary spending."
    },
    {
      "question": "Как далеко Коста-Бланка от России?",
      "answer": "Alicante Airport, serving Costa Blanca, operates 1,150 kilometers (715 miles) from London. Direct flights require approximately 2.5 hours, with multiple daily connections through major UK airports. Ferry alternatives via southern Spain require 24+ hours plus driving. The proximity enables frequent UK connectivity for professionals maintaining British interests while establishing Mediterranean residence. Many property owners maintain dual residency, spending 6-8 months in Costa Blanca annually."
    },
    {
      "question": "Подходит ли Коста-Бланка для пенсионеров?",
      "answer": "Excellent, particularly for British and Northern European retirees. The region combines affordable living, quality healthcare, established expat communities, and Mediterranean lifestyle. Spanish residency options specifically support retirement planning through non-lucrative visa pathways (€2,100/month income requirement) or property-acquisition routes. Pension income extends considerably further in Costa Blanca than UK equivalents. Social infrastructure—golf, clubs, restaurants, cultural events—provides engagement and community without isolation risks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Какая погода на Коста-Бланке?",
      "answer": "Mediterranean climate delivers 320+ days of annual sunshine with mild winters and warm summers. Temperature averages range 16°C (January) to 28°C (August), rarely exceeding 35°C or dropping below 10°C. Rainfall concentrates in autumn/spring with dry summers. The microclimate around Los Alcazares benefits from sea breezes moderating heat, creating particularly comfortable conditions. This consistency appeals to climate-sensitive retirees while supporting year-round outdoor activities and beach access."
    },
    {
      "question": "Нужна ли мне виза для покупки недвижимости в Испании?",
      "answer": "No visa requirement exists specifically for property purchase by foreign nationals. However, establishing residency post-acquisition involves visa applications through Spanish consulates. Non-lucrative visas (requiring €2,100/month passive income demonstration) suit retirees. Digital nomad visas support remote workers. Property ownership itself doesn't automatically grant residency, but creates foundation for subsequent applications. UK nationals currently navigate post-Brexit complexity through standard non-EU procedures, typically requiring documentation support from Spanish legal representatives."
    },
    {
      "question": "Могу ли я получить ипотеку в Испании как иностранец?",
      "answer": "Yes, most major Spanish and international banks provide mortgage financing to non-resident foreigners. Loan-to-value ratios typically reach 70-80% of property valuation. Interest rates for foreign buyers may slightly exceed Spanish citizen rates (currently 3.5-4.5% for quality applicants). Documentation requirements include income verification, employment history, and credit checks. English-language banking services through international divisions streamline the process. Many property buyers combine Spanish mortgage financing with UK pension income strategies, optimizing tax efficiency and cash flow."
