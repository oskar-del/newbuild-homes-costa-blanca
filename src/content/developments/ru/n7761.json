The town sits at a moderate elevation with a Mediterranean climate featuring warm, sunny days and mild winters—ideal for year-round outdoor family activities. Known historically for wine production and traditional craftsmanship, Pinoso has evolved into a welcoming destination for international families seeking genuine Spanish culture without the tourist overcrowding of coastal hotspots. The landscape around Pinoso features rolling hills, pine forests, and agricultural areas, providing a genuinely Spanish atmosphere while remaining connected to modern amenities. The town's infrastructure has been steadily improving to accommodate growing expat populations, with reliable utilities, good internet connectivity, and accessible shopping facilities. Despite its small-town charm, Pinoso benefits from proximity to larger Alicante services while maintaining lower property costs and a genuine community feel where neighbors actually know one another.",

Weekends often involve trips to nearby Blue Flag beaches (20 minutes), weekend markets featuring fresh local produce, and family-friendly restaurants serving both Spanish specialties and international cuisine. School hours structure family days, with quality educational options available locally. Healthcare access is straightforward with English-speaking doctors and private clinics complementing the regional hospital within 30 minutes. The pace of life is deliberately slower than coastal areas—less traffic, fewer tourists, more authentic Spanish traditions. Evening paseos (walks) through town, weekend fiestas, and golf outings at nearby championship courses provide regular social activities. Property owners typically spend time maintaining their gardens, enjoying outdoor spaces, and building friendships within the strong expat network.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Могут ли иностранцы купить недвижимость в Испании?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners can freely purchase Spanish property without restrictions. UK citizens, EU nationals, and non-EU citizens all have equal property-buying rights. The process requires Spanish tax identification number (NIE), legal representation, and completion of standard conveyancing.

    {
      "question": "Каковы расходы на покупку недвижимости в Испании?",
      "answer": "Beyond the property purchase price, expect additional costs: stamp duty (1.5% typically), notary fees (0.5-1%), registry fees (0.1%), and legal fees (1-2%). Total acquisition costs typically run 3-5% above purchase price. Ежегодные налоги на недвижимость (IBI) average 0.4-0.6% of property value. This Pinoso villa would incur approximately €15,000-20,000 total buying costs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Могу ли я получить ипотеку в Испании как иностранец?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers can obtain Spanish mortgages from major banks. Spanish lenders typically offer 60-70% loan-to-value ratios for non-residents, with 20-25 year terms.

      "question": "Нужна ли мне виза для покупки недвижимости в Испании?",
      "answer": "No, purchasing property doesn't require a visa. However, if planning to reside in Spain (beyond 90 days for UK citizens), you'll need appropriate visa/residency status. Post-Brexit UK citizens need digital nomad visa (90 days per 180), retirement visa (requiring minimum income), or family reunion visa.

    },
    {
      "question": "What rental income could this property generate?",
      "answer": "This villa typically generates €800 weekly rental income (€40,000 annually for 50-week rental season). Many owner-investors maintain 6-8 week personal use periods while letting remainder of year. Short-term vacation rental rates (€800/week) exceed long-term tenant rates (€1,200-1,500 monthly), making seasonal letting more profitable. Peak season (summer) commands premium rates. Realistic net income after costs runs €30,000-35,000 annually."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there good schools near this property?",
      "answer": "Yes. International schools with British curriculum operate 25-35 minutes away in larger towns. Spanish schools in Pinoso area provide quality bilingual education.
