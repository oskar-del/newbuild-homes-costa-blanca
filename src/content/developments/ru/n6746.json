The villa spans 216 square metres of meticulously designed living space across a generous 460-square-metre plot, offering the exclusive lifestyle associated with La Finca's prestigious golf community. What truly sets this property apart is its exceptional value proposition: at €2,773 per square metre, you're acquiring premium specification finishes at approximately 50% less than comparable coastal properties in Torrevieja and Guardamar. This represents intelligent acquisition for those who understand that location extends beyond proximity to the beach. The established golf community attracts a sophisticated international clientele, particularly British and Scandinavian buyers who appreciate the refined environment without the overcrowded coastal congestion. The market fundamentals support this acquisition, with the Algorfa area experiencing consistent 12% year-on-year appreciation, positioning this villa as both a lifestyle choice and a sound financial investment.",
  "areaSection": "Algorfa is a charming inland village that sits at the heart of the Costa Blanca's golf triangle, approximately 20 minutes from the Mediterranean coast. Nestled in the Vega Baja region of Alicante province, this authentic Spanish community has evolved into an exclusive enclave for golf enthusiasts and those seeking Mediterranean living without coastal overcrowding. The landscape is characterised by rolling hills, orange groves, and manicured golf courses that define the area's character. The climate is typically Mediterranean—warm, sun-drenched summers with average temperatures around 28°C, and mild winters averaging 12°C. Unlike the densely developed coastal strips, Algorfa maintains a relaxed, residential atmosphere where properties command premium pricing due to limited supply and exceptional demand from international buyers. The village centre retains authentic Spanish character while catering to its established international community, making it increasingly popular among buyers seeking quality of life and genuine investment potential.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Algorfa means embracing a sophisticated Mediterranean lifestyle characterised by outdoor pursuits, particularly golf, without sacrificing daily convenience. The English-speaking community at La Finca Golf and surrounding developments ensures seamless integration for international residents, with restaurants, cafés, and shops actively catering to international preferences. Daily life revolves around the golf courses—La Finca, Lo Romero, and Vistabella are minutes away—but the area equally attracts those who appreciate authentic Spanish culture and cuisine. The weekly markets in nearby Rojales and Guardamar offer fresh produce, whilst supermarkets including Mercadona provide international groceries familiar to expatriates. Cultural activities include traditional Spanish fiestas, gallery exhibitions, and fine dining establishments that have emerged to serve the affluent resident community. The proximity to Guardamar beaches (15 minutes) provides coastal access when desired, though most residents find sufficient leisure within the community itself. Healthcare is well-managed through local clinics and nearby Hospital de Torrevieja, with English-speaking practitioners widely available throughout the region.",

The established international golf community ensures consistent demand from both long-term residents and holiday rental markets. Unlike speculative coastal developments, Algorfa's limited villa supply, established infrastructure, and exclusive positioning provide genuine appreciation potential.
