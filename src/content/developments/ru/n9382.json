  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's property market has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth, particularly in centrally located beachfront properties. The town attracts approximately 2 million visitors annually, supporting a robust rental market for both short-term tourist lets and longer-term residential rentals. Properties in this location consistently achieve strong occupancy rates during the tourism season, with international visitors seeking authentic coastal experiences rather than resort-style accommodations.\n\nThe demographic shift toward remote work has accelerated demand for permanent rentals, as professionals increasingly choose to live full-time on the Costa Blanca rather than commuting to northern Europe. This penthouse's location ensures year-round rental potential, supported by Torrevieja's diverse appeal to retirees, digital nomads, and families. The relatively modest property size and modern amenities make it particularly attractive to younger demographic segments seeking affordable entry into the Costa Blanca property market.",
