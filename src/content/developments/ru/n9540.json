With 112m² of thoughtfully designed living space set on a 160m² plot, your family will have room to grow and enjoy outdoor activities together.

  "areaSection": "San Pedro del Pinatar is a charming coastal town in Murcia that has evolved into one of the Costa Blanca's most authentic destinations. Situated between the Mar Menor lagoon and the Mediterranean, this town enjoys a stunning Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually. Unlike the over-developed beachfront areas, San Pedro del Pinatar maintains its Spanish character while welcoming an international community. The town benefits from excellent connectivity – Alicante Airport is just 50 minutes away, and you're positioned between the vibrant cities of Murcia and Cartagena. The local economy thrives on tourism, fishing, and agriculture, creating a balanced, sustainable community. With modern infrastructure and authentic Spanish charm, San Pedro del Pinatar offers families the best of both worlds: a genuine Spanish lifestyle with modern conveniences and English-speaking support systems.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Life in San Pedro del Pinatar revolves around family, community, and enjoying the Mediterranean. Your mornings might start with a coffee at a local café where you'll increasingly recognize familiar faces from the established expat community. The town's extensive network of restaurants, tapas bars, and beachfront chiringuitos means weekend family meals are part of the social fabric. Shopping is convenient with Mercadona, Lidl, and Consum supermarkets, plus weekly local markets offering fresh produce and seafood. The beaches are your playground – multiple Blue Flag beaches lie within 20 minutes, perfect for weekend family outings.

  "investmentSection": "Beyond being an ideal family home, this villa represents a strong investment opportunity. San Pedro del Pinatar's property market is appreciating at approximately 8% year-on-year, outpacing inflation and delivering genuine capital growth. The rental market remains robust – comparable properties in this location achieve approximately €800 per week during peak season, translating to excellent yield potential if you choose to let the property. At €3,661/m², you're paying significantly less than equivalent properties in Mallorca, Ibiza, or other Spanish island markets where prices routinely exceed €6,000/m². This price differential reflects genuine value, not location compromise – you're simply avoiding the island premium. For families considering whether this could become a future rental investment, the established tourism infrastructure and stable expat community create reliable demand. Many families purchase here as a primary residence with the option to generate income during periods they don't use the property.",
