  "areaSection": "Lorca is a historic town in the heart of Murcia, situated between the dramatic Sierra de Espuña mountains and the plains leading toward the coast. This strategic location places you just 20 minutes from pristine Blue Flag beaches while maintaining the tranquility of an authentic Spanish inland community. The town has experienced steady development in recent years, with property prices rising 8% year-on-year, reflecting growing buyer confidence in the area. The climate is quintessentially Mediterranean—warm, sunny summers tempered by sea breezes, and mild winters that rarely drop below 10°C. Lorca's rich cultural heritage, including its stunning 13th-century castle and baroque cathedral, creates a genuinely Spanish atmosphere without the mass tourism found in coastal resorts. The surrounding countryside offers olive groves, almond orchards, and quiet villages perfect for weekend exploration. For families, Lorca provides an authentic slice of Spanish life with modern amenities, making it increasingly popular with relocating British families seeking genuine community integration rather than isolated expat enclaves.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Lorca revolves around genuine Spanish traditions combined with modern convenience. Your family will enjoy leisurely paseos through tree-lined plazas, shopping at the vibrant daily market where locals source fresh produce, and dining at family-run restaurants serving authentic regional cuisine at reasonable prices. The established international community means children quickly make friends, with English spoken in schools, shops, and among the growing expat population. Weekends offer flexibility—head to the beach for swimming and paella, explore the Sierra de Espuña for hiking and nature photography, or visit nearby golf courses for weekend activities. Healthcare is excellent with a regional hospital 30 minutes away and English-speaking doctors available. Shopping needs are easily met with Mercadona, Lidl, and Consum supermarkets stocking familiar brands alongside Spanish staples. The cost of living is significantly lower than UK equivalents—a family of four typically spends 30-40% less on groceries, dining, and utilities. Bus connections provide public transport, though families generally prefer the flexibility of a car for exploring the region's beaches, villages, and countryside attractions.",
  "investmentSection": "Beyond personal enjoyment, this property offers genuine investment potential in a market showing positive momentum. Lorca property prices have increased 8% year-on-year, outpacing broader Spanish market growth and reflecting rising demand from both European buyers and Spanish nationals seeking value. At €2,759 per square meter—40% cheaper than equivalent properties in Mallorca, Ibiza, or coastal Costa Blanca resorts—there's significant upside potential as the town develops further. Typical rental yields of €800 per week (€41,600 annually) make this attractive for families wanting occasional income from short-term holiday lets, particularly during summer months when beach-goers seek inland villa bases. Long-term rental potential is equally strong, with established expat and Spanish tenant demand. The combination of affordability, development trajectory, and dual-income potential creates a compelling investment case alongside the obvious lifestyle benefits of family ownership.",
