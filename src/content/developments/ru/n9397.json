  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's real estate market has demonstrated consistent appreciation over the past decade, driven by steady population growth and genuine lifestyle appeal rather than speculative tourism. The city attracts both Spanish nationals relocating from Madrid and Barcelona, plus Northern European retirees seeking reliable climate and established expatriate communities. This diverse demand base creates stable rental potential—vacation rentals during peak summer months (June-September) typically achieve 60-70% occupancy rates, while longer-term rentals to professionals and retirees provide year-round income stability.\n\nLa Hoya's contemporary developments particularly appeal to rental markets. Young professionals and visiting families specifically seek modern apartments with reliable amenities over traditional villas. Your 2-bedroom configuration hits the optimal rental market sweet spot—large enough for families, compact enough for couples, versatile enough for short-term tourists or long-term tenants. Conservative estimates suggest 4-5% annual rental yields, with appreciation potential as Torrevieja's infrastructure continues developing. The new build status provides additional advantage, offering warranty protection and reliability that attracts quality tenants.",
