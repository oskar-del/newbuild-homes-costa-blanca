  "heroIntro": "This 3-bedroom apartment in Torre Pacheco presents a compelling investment opportunity at €196,000—20% below the local market average of €2,200/m². Located in the Centro district, this property offers exceptional value in a market experiencing consistent 8% year-on-year appreciation. The €1,750/m² price point positions it attractively against broader Costa Blanca markets, while rental demand remains strong with typical weekly holiday lets commanding €800 in this established region.

The town serves as a regional commercial and residential center, supporting over 30,000 residents with modern infrastructure and established amenities. Situated approximately 35km from Alicante Airport and 30km from pristine Blue Flag beaches, Torre Pacheco offers the practical balance investors seek—close enough to coast-dependent tourism but with lower property costs than beachfront markets. The climate is Mediterranean with over 300 days of sunshine annually, mild winters (average 8-15°C), and warm summers (25-35°C). Regional development has driven consistent property appreciation, making Torre Pacheco increasingly attractive for both residential and investment purchases across European buyer demographics.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Каковы расходы на покупку недвижимости в Испании?",

      "question": "What are property taxes in Spain?",
      "answer": "Annual property tax (Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles) is approximately 0.4-1.1% of fiscal value (typically lower than purchase price). For €196,000 property, annual tax is roughly €780-2,160 depending on municipal assessment. Additionally, non-resident owners pay 19% corporate income tax on rental income, though legitimate expenses reduce taxable amounts. Professional accountant management of tax obligations is recommended for optimized compliance and deduction strategies."
