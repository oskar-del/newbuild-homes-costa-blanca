    },
    {
      "question": "Могут ли иностранцы купить недвижимость в Испании?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign buyers purchase property in Spain without restrictions. Non-residents can buy residential properties freely, though you'll need a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and must comply with non-resident property regulations. Professional legal support (conveyancer/abogado) handles requirements—budget €2,000-€4,000 in professional fees for transaction completion.

This includes: transfer tax (6-8% depending on region), legal fees (€2,000-€4,000), conveyancing costs, notary fees (0.5-1%), and property registration. For a €223,000 property, expect total purchase costs of approximately €18,000-€22,000. Annual ownership costs include property tax (0.4-1.1%), community fees if applicable (variable), and insurance.

You'll need proof of income, passport identification, and often a deposit of 20%. Banks prefer UK income documentation or savings evidence. The process takes 4-6 weeks with professional legal support. Many foreign buyers find Spanish mortgages attractive for leverage while retaining capital for investment or living expenses."
