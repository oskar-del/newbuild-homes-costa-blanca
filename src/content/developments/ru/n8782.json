This strategic location combines the tranquility of inland living with easy access to coastal attractions. The area enjoys 320+ days of annual sunshine, with mild winters and warm summers—ideal for those escaping harsher climates. Originally developed as a planned community, Ciudad Quesada has evolved into a mature, well-established neighborhood with excellent infrastructure. The town benefits from modern amenities, reliable services, and a cosmopolitan atmosphere.

      "question": "Могут ли иностранцы купить недвижимость в Испании?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreigners have exactly the same property purchase rights as Spanish citizens. No special permits or restrictions apply. You'll need a Spanish Tax ID number (simple to obtain) and must use a notary to complete the transaction—standard practice that protects your interests.

      "question": "Каковы расходы на покупку недвижимости в Испании?",

Renovations or improvements vary by scope. Annual ownership costs include property tax (0.4-1.1% of registered value annually), utilities, and optional maintenance. These costs remain very reasonable compared to Northern Europe, contributing to Spain's attractiveness for retirees."

    },
    {
      "question": "Подходит ли Коста-Бланка для пенсионеров?",
      "answer": "Excellent. Costa Blanca has become a retirement destination specifically because it offers year-round sunshine, affordable living, outstanding healthcare, established English-speaking communities, and Mediterranean lifestyle. The infrastructure—from healthcare to markets to recreational activities—is mature and reliable. Many residents live here 20+ years, developing deep community connections and enjoying genuinely happy retirements. The relaxed pace and friendly environment are particularly valued by those leaving stressful careers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Как далеко Коста-Бланка от России?",
      "answer": "Approximately 1,400 kilometers (870 miles). Direct flights from Alicante Airport to UK destinations take 2.5-3 hours. Multiple daily flights make visiting family easy and affordable. Many retirees visit UK quarterly while maintaining permanent residence in Spain. The combination of direct flights and reasonable flight costs means staying connected with UK family while enjoying Spanish retirement—having both worlds."

The Mediterranean climate is gentle—not extreme. Inland Ciudad Quesada stays cooler than coastal areas during summer heat. This reliably pleasant weather supports year-round outdoor activities without the harsh winters many retirees escape or brutal summers that exhaust elderly residents. Most people report their arthritis and respiratory conditions improve significantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Могу ли я получить ипотеку в Испании как иностранец?",
      "answer": "Yes, several Spanish banks and international lenders offer mortgages to foreign buyers, typically up to 80% of property value. Terms are generally favorable (3-4% interest rates). You'll need proof of income, savings, and a Spanish Tax ID. Many expat financial advisors specialize in helping foreign buyers navigate mortgage options. Some prefer to purchase outright given excellent value and cost-of-living advantages. Professional advice helps optimize your financial strategy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is this property priced at €4,110/m² when the area average is €2,200/m²?",
      "answer": "This represents premium specification pricing reflecting the bungalow's quality finishes, thoughtful design, and location within Ciudad Quesada's most developed areas. Comparable properties in equivalent condition command similar prices. What makes this exceptional value is the 40% discount versus Spanish islands—equivalent properties in Ibiza, Mallorca, or Canaries cost €6,500-7,500/m². You're paying for quality at dramatically below-market rates, with 8% annual appreciation providing strong investment fundamentals."
