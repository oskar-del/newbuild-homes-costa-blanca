The town benefits from a subtropical climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually, perfect for outdoor family activities year-round. Almoradi has experienced steady growth in recent years, with property values rising 8% year-on-year, yet it maintains a relaxed, village-like feel compared to busier resort towns.
