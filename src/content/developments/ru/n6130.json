This €1,350,000 property represents a remarkable investment opportunity for discerning buyers seeking premium Costa Blanca properties.

  "areaSection": "Finestrat occupies a privileged position on the northern Costa Blanca, nestled between the Mediterranean coastline and the dramatic limestone peaks of the Serra Gelada. This municipality of approximately 3,500 residents maintains an authentically Spanish character while accommodating an established international community. The Mediterranean climate ensures over 300 days of sunshine annually, with mild winters and warm summers tempered by sea breezes. Finestrat's elevation provides distinct advantages: cooler summer temperatures than coastal developments, reduced noise from tourist traffic, and panoramic vistas across the Mediterranean. The town's compact size fosters a genuine sense of community while remaining just minutes from major amenities. The hillside setting creates natural drainage and exceptional air quality, qualities increasingly valued by health-conscious property owners. Infrastructure investment has modernized Finestrat without compromising its character, with improved roads and utility services supporting contemporary residential development.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Living in Finestrat offers a distinctly Mediterranean lifestyle without the intensity of larger coastal resorts. The established expatriate community—predominantly European—has created an environment where English is widely spoken and international perspectives are welcomed. Daily life revolves around quality rather than quantity: local restaurants serve traditional paella alongside contemporary Mediterranean cuisine, weekly markets overflow with regional produce, and a cooperative spirit defines social interactions. The proximity to Blue Flag beaches—multiple options within 20 minutes—allows flexibility between coastal recreation and mountain tranquility. Golf enthusiasts benefit from several championship courses within easy driving distance. Healthcare access is comprehensive, with private clinics offering English-speaking specialists and a modern regional hospital serving complex medical needs. Shopping ranges from traditional Spanish markets to modern supermarkets including Mercadona, Lidl, and Consum. The international school system provides British curriculum education for families relocating with children. This lifestyle appeals particularly to affluent retirees, remote professionals, and families seeking Mediterranean living without Mediterranean chaos.",
  "investmentSection": "Property investment on the Costa Blanca demonstrates consistent appreciation, with the market trending positively at 8% year-on-year. Finestrat specifically outperforms the wider area average, with properties trading at €2,200 per square metre versus this villa's €2,778 per square metre—representing a premium positioning justified by specification and location. Rental potential adds significant returns: comparable properties in Campana Garden command approximately €800 per week for 7-night lets, potentially generating €40,000+ annually from strategic short-term lettings. The premium specification reduces maintenance costs while justifying premium rental rates. For owner-occupiers, the financing advantage remains significant: European mortgage providers readily finance properties in established communities with transparent legal ownership. The 40% valuation advantage versus Spanish island properties positions this asset as a superior alternative to Balearic or Canary properties at comparable prices.",
