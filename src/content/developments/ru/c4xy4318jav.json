The town's three distinct beaches and numerous hidden coves offer unparalleled coastal variety within a single municipality. Javea's development has been carefully controlled, preserving its character whilst accommodating a sophisticated international community. Unlike the high-rise urban sprawl of southern Costa Blanca resorts, Javea maintains a distinctly Mediterranean character with whitewashed architecture, pine-covered hillsides, and genuine local traditions coexisting with international amenities.
