The Mar Menor's shallow, warm waters create ideal conditions for water sports and family activities. Recent infrastructure improvements have enhanced accessibility while maintaining the town's relaxed atmosphere. Unlike overcrowded tourist zones, Los Alcazares retains genuine local flavor while welcoming international residents and visitors seeking authentic coastal living.",

      "answer": "No visa is required for purchasing property in Spain. EU citizens enjoy unrestricted access.

    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Los Alcazares different from other Costa Blanca towns?",
      "answer": "Los Alcazares combines authentic Spanish character with international infrastructure, avoiding the over-development plaguing many coastal towns.

The undersupply of quality holiday rentals creates genuine investment advantage versus saturated markets."
