  "areaSection": "Calpe occupies a dramatic position on the northern Costa Blanca, dominated by the iconic Peñón de Ifach, a UNESCO-protected limestone massif rising 332 meters from the shoreline. This distinctive geography creates a natural amphitheater of Mediterranean charm, where crystalline waters meet golden beaches—Arenal-Bol, Cantal Roig, and La Fossa among them. The municipality benefits from a microclimate that extends the summer season, with average temperatures of 18°C in winter and 27°C in summer, creating exceptional year-round living conditions. Calpe's dual-season economy—summer tourism balanced with permanent international residents—has fostered sophisticated infrastructure and cosmopolitan services rarely found in smaller coastal towns. The established expatriate community, predominantly British and German, has cultivated an environment where English is widely spoken, healthcare providers offer international standards, and cultural amenities reflect international tastes.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Calpe epitomizes Mediterranean sophistication without compromising on convenience. The established expatriate community—particularly strong among British and German nationals—has cultivated an environment of cultural appreciation where fine dining, boutique shopping, and international healthcare operate alongside traditional Spanish beach culture. Your mornings might begin with coffee at one of the seafront chiringuitos before a round at Club de Golf Ifach, just 5 minutes away. Supermarkets including Mercadona, Consum, and Lidl provide international selections alongside local produce at weekly markets. The private healthcare sector features English-speaking practitioners at modern clinics, complemented by Hospital de Dénia (30 minutes) for specialized care.
