    {
      "question": "Is 400m really walkable to the beach?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. 400 meters is approximately a 5-minute leisurely walk. For perspective, most Spanish city-dwellers consider anything under 1km genuinely walkable. You can easily stroll to Playa del Cura for morning swims or beach sunsets without needing transportation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the actual noise situation in Centro Torrevieja?",
      "answer": "City center locations have ambient urban activity—this is authentic city living, not resort quietude. Summer evenings bring active nightlife, street activity remains until midnight in high season. Winter months are considerably quieter. Modern apartment construction provides adequate sound insulation. If absolute silence is essential, suburban properties might suit you better."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I rely on rental income from this property?",
      "answer": "Central Torrevieja apartments maintain strong rental demand, particularly October-April. Realistically expect 5-7% annual yields with potential gaps in shoulder seasons. Professional property management companies operate throughout Torrevieja, typically charging 30-40% of rental income. Summer months can see booking challenges when many Europeans stay elsewhere. Treat rental income as supplementary rather than primary income."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's Torrevieja's healthcare situation?",
      "answer": "Torrevieja hosts Hospital Universitario Torrevieja (1.2km away), a modern private facility offering excellent care. Public healthcare through Spanish system is also available. The city has developed as a medical tourism destination, attracting quality healthcare professionals. Most European health standards are met or exceeded."
    },
    {
      "question": "How's Torrevieja's weather compared to other Costa Blanca locations?",
      "answer": "Torrevieja enjoys approximately 300 sunshine days annually with average winter temperatures around 13-15°C and summer peaks around 32°C. It's sunnier and slightly warmer than northern Costa Blanca sections. The salt lake influence creates occasional unique weather patterns, but overall conditions are consistently Mediterranean with minimal rainfall."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this a property for long-term residence or investment primarily?",
      "answer": "The central location supports both purposes excellently. Owner-occupants benefit from urban convenience and beach proximity. Investors gain from proven rental demand. The area attracts diverse demographics—retirees seeking active communities, families needing services, remote workers, and seasonal renters—providing flexibility in how you utilize the property."
