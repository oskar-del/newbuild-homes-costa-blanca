  "areaSection": "Javea, positioned on Costa Blanca's northern edge, commands its elevated status through a combination of natural beauty and carefully preserved character. This ancient fishing town sits between two dramatic headlands, creating a spectacular natural amphitheatre overlooking the Mediterranean. The region experiences over 300 days of annual sunshine with a temperate climate that attracts visitors and residents year-round. Javea's geography—nestled between the mountains and sea—provides exceptional natural protection while maintaining the dramatic coastal vistas that define premium Mediterranean properties. Unlike overdeveloped neighbouring towns, Javea has maintained strict planning regulations that preserve its architectural integrity and natural landscape. The town's elevation of approximately 100 metres above sea level provides relief from the intense summer heat while offering panoramic views across the Mediterranean. This combination of thoughtful development, natural protection, and geographical position has established Javea as the Costa Blanca's most exclusive residential destination.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Life in Javea represents a refined adjustment to Mediterranean living, where daily existence is calibrated around beaches, culture, and community. The town supports a substantial and established international community—British, German, and Dutch residents have created a sophisticated social infrastructure complete with respected international schools, English-language services, and cultural institutions. Dining culture reflects both authentic Spanish traditions and international sophistication, with everything from Michelin-worthy establishments to traditional family-run tapas bars. The weekly markets provide exceptional fresh produce and local products, while supermarkets cater to international preferences with imported goods and specialist items. Healthcare access rivals Northern European standards, with English-speaking medical professionals, modern clinics, and proximity to major hospitals in Denia and beyond. Recreation extends far beyond beaches—five golf courses within 25 minutes, water sports facilities, hiking trails through protected natural areas, and a vibrant arts scene provide intellectual and physical stimulation. The expatriate community has established book clubs, charity organisations, language schools, and social groups that create genuine community without the superficiality common in less established resort areas.",
  "investmentSection": "This property represents a strategically sound investment within Spain's most resilient coastal real estate market. Javea has demonstrated consistent 6% year-on-year price appreciation, outperforming broader Costa Blanca trends while maintaining sophisticated buyer demographics that stabilise values. The rental market supports strong income potential—comparable 2-bedroom properties command €1,400 per week during summer season, generating annual rental income of €72,800 at modest utilisation rates. Unlike speculative markets, Javea attracts owner-occupiers and long-term investors who support property values through genuine demand. The town's international standing, protected natural environment, and strict planning regulations create artificial supply constraints that typically benefit property holders. Tax considerations favour non-resident EU property investment, with Spain's rental income taxation comparable to other EU nations. When compared to Mallorca—where equivalent properties command 30% premiums—Javea offers superior value positioning alongside established market fundamentals. Currency diversification benefits for non-Euro investors provide additional portfolio protection.",
