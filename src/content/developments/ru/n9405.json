  "areaSection": "Jávea Xàbia occupies a unique geographical position along Costa Blanca's northern coastline, where the dramatic Montgó mountain range meets the Mediterranean Sea. This strategic location delivers a Mediterranean climate characterized by 300 days of annual sunshine, temperate winters, and refreshing sea breezes that moderate summer temperatures.

Valle del Sol specifically sits within this established residential zone, offering the privacy and tranquility of hillside living while maintaining immediate proximity to Jávea Xàbia's cultural, commercial, and recreational infrastructure. The region's geological diversity, featuring limestone peaks and sheltered coves, has naturally limited overdevelopment, preserving the exclusivity that distinguishes Jávea Xàbia from more commercialized Costa Blanca destinations.",
