  "metaTitle": "3 Спален Villa Torrevieja - 2km Sea | N8628",
  "metaDescription": "Modern 3-bed villa in Torrevieja, Sector 25. 141m² built, 247m² plot. Just 2km from Mediterranean beaches. New construction.",
  "heroIntro": "Welcome to a new era of coastal living in Torrevieja. This contemporary 3-bedroom villa represents modern Mediterranean architecture at its finest, situated in the desirable Sector 25 area just 2 kilometers from the crystalline waters of the Costa Blanca. Reference N8628 offers a rare opportunity to own a newly constructed home in one of Spain's most vibrant seaside towns, where year-round sunshine meets sophisticated urban amenities.\n\nTorrevieja has undergone remarkable transformation over recent years, evolving from a quiet fishing village into a thriving cosmopolitan destination. This villa capitalizes on that growth, providing new owners with contemporary design standards and energy-efficient construction while maintaining proximity to the beach lifestyle you're seeking. The 141 square meters of thoughtfully planned interior space flow naturally across a single story, maximizing light and creating seamless connections between living areas.\n\nWith just 2 kilometers separating you from the shoreline, beach days become part of your daily routine rather than occasional excursions. The location balances beachside convenience with access to Torrevieja's established infrastructure, including international schools, healthcare facilities, shopping districts, and the thriving expatriate community that has made this region their home.",
  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's rental market remains robust, supported by consistent year-round tourism, seasonal Spanish and European visitors, and growing long-term expat rentals. Properties near the coast, particularly those within easy beach access, maintain strong rental demand from international visitors seeking authentic Mediterranean experiences. The 2-kilometer proximity to beaches makes this villa competitive for short-term holiday rentals, while the modern construction and turnkey condition minimize ongoing maintenance costs that erode investment returns.\n\nBeyond rental income, Torrevieja itself has demonstrated steady property appreciation over the past decade. The town's continued development, improved infrastructure, environmental cleanup of the salt lakes, and expanding expat communities suggest sustained interest in the area. New villa construction in this sector indicates developer confidence, and completed projects typically appreciate beyond initial purchase prices within 3-5 years as the neighborhood establishes itself further.",
