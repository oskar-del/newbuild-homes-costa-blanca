This 3-bedroom, 3-bathroom villa offers the perfect balance of space to grow and genuine value in one of Spain's most family-friendly communities. At €359,900, you're purchasing a premium specification property at 40% less than comparable Spanish island markets—a significant advantage for families looking to maximize their investment while securing quality living space. The property spans 128m² of thoughtfully designed living areas, set on a 218m² plot that provides room for children to play, gardens to cultivate, and outdoor entertaining space for weekend gatherings. Daya Nueva has become increasingly popular with British and Northern European families who appreciate its proximity to excellent schools, safe neighborhoods, and established expat community where English is widely spoken. This villa represents not just a property purchase, but an investment in a lifestyle where your family can truly settle in and thrive.",
  "areaSection": "Daya Nueva is a charming village in the heart of Alicante province, just 30 minutes from the coast yet maintaining an authentic Spanish village character that many families prefer. Located inland on the Costa Blanca, it benefits from a Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of sunshine annually, yet avoids the intense summer heat of coastal areas. The village sits at an ideal elevation that provides beautiful views across the Vega Baja region while maintaining peaceful, small-town living. Historically, Daya Nueva developed as an agricultural community, and this heritage is reflected in its traditional architecture and strong sense of community. Today, the village has modernized thoughtfully, with improved infrastructure and services while preserving its authentic character. The local economy thrives on both agriculture and international residents who have discovered its charm, creating a genuine bicultural community where Spanish traditions and international perspectives coexist harmoniously.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Daya Nueva revolves around genuine community and practical convenience. Your family will enjoy a peaceful village atmosphere where neighbors genuinely know each other, yet you're never far from essential services. The established expat community means you'll find English speakers everywhere—from local shops to healthcare providers—removing barriers to settling in. Mornings might include a coffee at the local café where families gather before school runs. The village has a good selection of supermarkets including Mercadona, Lidl, and Consum, plus weekly markets where locals and residents source fresh produce. Healthcare is excellent with English-speaking doctors readily available and the regional hospital just 30 minutes away. For leisure, you're within 20 minutes of multiple Blue Flag beaches perfect for family days out, while golf courses and nature parks offer weekend adventures. Evenings often feature outdoor entertaining in your garden or relaxed dinners at family-friendly restaurants throughout the village. The pace is slower than coastal towns, but the connectivity is excellent—balancing peaceful living with easy access to everything your family needs.",
  "investmentSection": "This property represents strong investment value in a rising market. Daya Nueva has experienced consistent 8% year-on-year price appreciation, outpacing many other Costa Blanca locations due to its appeal to families and retirees seeking authentic Spanish living. At €2,812/m², this villa commands a 28% premium over the local average of €2,200/m², justified by premium specification and condition—yet remains remarkably affordable compared to island markets like Mallorca or Ibiza where similar properties command 40% higher prices. The rental market is equally attractive: holiday lets typically achieve €800 per week, generating strong passive income for investors with family use flexibility. Many owners successfully balance personal occupation during peak summer months with rental income during spring and autumn seasons. The combination of strong capital appreciation potential, reliable rental returns, and genuine family living appeal makes this an excellent dual-purpose investment that doesn't require choosing between personal enjoyment and financial returns.",
  "conclusion": "This villa represents exactly what discerning families seek: authentic Spanish village living with genuine community connection, quality schools and healthcare nearby, and investment value that doesn't exist in overpriced coastal markets. At €359,900 with premium specifications and strong appreciation potential, you're acquiring not just property but a lifestyle where your family can genuinely settle and thrive. The established English-speaking community removes integration barriers, while proximity to beaches, golf, and cultural attractions ensures endless weekend activities.

Unlike some speculative markets, Costa Blanca prices are grounded in real demand from people genuinely relocating here."

Rental income from holiday lets incurs Spanish income tax (typically 19-45% depending on total income), though many owners structure this through Spanish limited companies. Capital gains tax applies when you sell (19% standard rate), calculated only on profit, not total sale price."
    },
    {
      "question": "Могу ли я получить ипотеку в Испании как иностранец?",
      "answer": "Yes, many Spanish and international banks offer mortgages to foreign buyers. You'll typically need 30-40% deposit, proof of income, and a Spanish NIE number.

    {
      "question": "What's the weather like in Daya Nueva?",
      "answer": "Daya Nueva enjoys Mediterranean climate with over 300 days of annual sunshine. Summers (June-September) average 28-32°C with low humidity and evening sea breezes. Winters are mild (10-16°C) with occasional rainfall. Spring and autumn are perfect with 18-24°C temperatures ideal for outdoor activities.

      "answer": "Alicante Airport, just 35 minutes from this property, has direct flights to every major UK airport (London, Manchester, Birmingham, etc.) with multiple daily departures. Flight time is typically 2 hours 15 minutes. Budget airlines offer competitive pricing (often £30-80 return) making UK visits convenient.
