  "areaSection": "San Juan de los Terreros is a charming coastal town in Almería, approximately 45 minutes south of Alicante airport and nestled along the Mar de Pulpí coastline. This relatively undiscovered gem combines the best of authentic Spanish coastal living with modern convenience. The town benefits from a year-round mild Mediterranean climate—with average temperatures of 18°C in winter and 26°C in summer—making outdoor activities possible throughout the year. Unlike overcrowded tourist hotspots, San Juan de los Terreros maintains its character as a working fishing village mixed with residential development, offering genuine local culture alongside contemporary amenities. The beaches here are clean and maintained to Blue Flag standards, and the town is surrounded by dramatic cliffs and natural beauty that provide a stunning backdrop to daily life. With a population that includes a significant international community, the area has evolved to meet the needs of British, German, and Scandinavian residents while remaining authentically Spanish.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in San Juan de los Terreros revolves around the beach, local restaurants, and a tight-knit community of expatriates and Spanish families. The established international presence means English is widely spoken in shops, restaurants, and at schools, easing the transition for British families. Mornings might begin with a café con leche at a beachfront bar, lunch often involves fresh seafood from local restaurants, and weekends bring outdoor activities—kayaking, hiking the nearby cliffs, or exploring regional markets. The town has excellent supermarkets including Mercadona, Lidl, and Consum, plus a vibrant weekly market for fresh produce and local goods. For families, the slower pace compared to major cities like Alicante or Málaga means less traffic stress, safer neighborhoods, and more time for what matters. The expat community is well-established, offering everything from international schools to sports clubs and social groups. Healthcare access is comprehensive, with private clinics offering English-speaking doctors and a regional hospital 30 minutes away. This is a place where you genuinely live, rather than constantly visit.",
  "investmentSection": "Beyond being an exceptional family home, this villa represents a solid investment opportunity. The Costa Blanca property market is experiencing 8% year-on-year growth, with San Juan de los Terreros particularly attractive to European buyers seeking authentic Mediterranean living at reasonable prices. At €1,893/m², you're purchasing 40% below island market prices (Canaries, Balearics) while accessing the same quality of life.

Many families split their ownership, renting during summer months to offset costs. The town's growing popularity among remote workers and retirees suggests continued appreciation. With mortgage interest rates now more favorable for international buyers, and the Spanish government actively encouraging property investment, this villa offers both lifestyle benefits and financial appreciation potential.",
