      "question": "Подходит ли Коста-Бланка для пенсионеров?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Какая погода на Коста-Бланке?",
      "answer": "Exceptional. Costa Blanca averages 300+ sunshine days annually with Mediterranean warmth. Summers (June-September) see temperatures of 25-30°C; winters (December-February) average 10°C daytime with minimal rainfall. Humidity is moderate thanks to sea breezes. This climate supports outdoor living much of the year—beach days, golf, café culture—making it ideal for holiday home owners seeking genuine sunshine retreats."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need residency to buy this property?",
      "answer": "No residency is required to purchase property in Spain. Foreign nationals can buy freely with only a Spanish tax identification number (NIE).

Our legal team guides you through both purchase and residency pathways based on your intended usage—holiday home, rental investment, or eventual relocation."
