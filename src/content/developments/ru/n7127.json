Priced at €379,900, this property represents extraordinary value—premium specification at 40% less than comparable properties on Spanish islands.

At €4,417 per square metre, you're acquiring premium quality at genuinely competitive pricing compared to oversaturated island markets.",
  "areaSection": "Finestrat is a charming coastal town nestled between the sophisticated beaches of Benidorm and the quieter coves to the south. This hillside location offers the perfect balance: close enough to amenities and beaches (within 20 minutes), yet maintains a more relaxed, authentic Spanish atmosphere than crowded coastal developments. The terrain gently slopes toward the Mediterranean, creating natural elevation that delivers exceptional light and air circulation. Finestrat's microclimate benefits from protection by surrounding hills, moderating summer temperatures while maintaining the region's legendary 300+ annual sunshine hours. The town has evolved into a favoured spot for discerning international buyers seeking genuine value without sacrificing quality infrastructure or access to world-class beaches and entertainment.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Finestrat revolves around seamless integration of relaxation and activity. Your mornings might begin with coffee at a local café where English is widely spoken, thanks to the established international community. Beaches are a 15-20 minute drive, making afternoon swims and Blue Flag beach clubs part of your routine rather than special occasions. The town centre offers excellent Spanish supermarkets (Mercadona, Consum, Lidl) alongside weekly markets brimming with local produce. Healthcare is outstanding—regional hospitals and private English-speaking clinics are accessible within 30 minutes. For golf enthusiasts, championship courses are minutes away. Evenings blend sunset aperitivos with international restaurants or authentic paella dinners. The expat community ensures you're never isolated, yet Spanish culture remains authentic and accessible. This isn't an artificial resort bubble; it's a genuine town where international and Spanish residents coexist naturally.",
  "investmentSection": "Beyond the lifestyle appeal, this property represents solid financial opportunity. Finestrat has experienced +8% year-on-year property appreciation, outpacing broader Costa Blanca trends. Comparable 3-bedroom properties in the area typically command €450,000-€520,000. This bungalow's strategic pricing reflects both current market conditions and strong growth momentum. Holiday rental data is compelling: similar properties generate approximately €800 per week during peak season (July-September), easily covering annual expenses. Off-season lettings (spring/autumn) sustain consistent income. Many owners operate part-time holiday let models—enjoying personal use while generating €12,000-€16,000 annually from seasonal rentals. The combination of established infrastructure, international demand, and favourable pricing creates conditions where appreciation and rental income work simultaneously in your favour.",
  "conclusion": "This Finestrat bungalow isn't just a property purchase—it's an investment in lifestyle transformation. At €379,900, you're acquiring premium specification, proven appreciation potential, rental income possibilities, and immediate access to Mediterranean living at significantly better value than island alternatives.
