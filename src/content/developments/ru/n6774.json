This distinctive landmark has made Calpe one of Spain's most recognizable coastal destinations, attracting a sophisticated international demographic. The town benefits from a Mediterranean climate characterized by 300 days of sunshine annually, with mild winters and warm, yet temperate summers—ideal for year-round living rather than seasonal visits. The elevation of Pla Roig places it above the summer heat of the coastal strip, providing natural cooling and panoramic vistas. Calpe's unique topography creates distinct neighborhoods, with Pla Roig positioned as the most prestigious residential enclave, separate from tourist zones while maintaining convenient access to amenities. The area's development has been carefully controlled, preserving the balance between modern convenience and Mediterranean authenticity that appeals to discerning international residents.",
