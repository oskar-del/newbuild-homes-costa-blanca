The property's premium specification and strategic location in a well-established expat community means you'll enjoy both modern conveniences and authentic Mediterranean culture—the ultimate sunshine retreat.",
  "areaSection": "El Verger sits on the northern Costa Blanca, a picturesque coastal town that has maintained its authentic Spanish character while welcoming an international community of discerning buyers. Located between the larger towns of Dénia and Jávea, El Verger offers the perfect middle ground—close enough to amenities and infrastructure, yet far enough removed from mass tourism to preserve its genuine charm.\n\nThe town benefits from over 300 days of annual sunshine, with mild winters and warm summers ideal for year-round enjoyment. The nearby Playa de La Almadraba beach is a pristine stretch of Mediterranean coastline, one of several Blue Flag beaches within 20 minutes. The landscape features dramatic coastal cliffs, hidden coves, and a backdrop of mountains that shift color with the seasons. This is a place where time moves differently—where the pace of life naturally slows to match the rhythm of the Mediterranean.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in El Verger revolves around sensible pleasures: morning coffee at a beachfront chiringuito, afternoon shopping at the weekly market where locals gather to share news and fresh produce, evening walks along the seafront. The established international community—predominantly British, Dutch, and Nordic residents—has created a welcoming environment where English is widely spoken, yet you're surrounded by authentic Spanish culture.\n\nYour mornings might start with a beach walk before heading to one of several excellent restaurants serving fresh Mediterranean cuisine. The town's supermarkets (Mercadona, Lidl, Consum) stock everything you'd need, while local markets burst with seasonal produce from the surrounding agricultural region. Healthcare is straightforward with private clinics offering English-speaking doctors and a regional hospital 30 minutes away. For those seeking activity, championship golf courses, water sports, and hiking trails provide endless entertainment. Evenings blend seamlessly—perhaps a sunset vermouth at the port, dinner with friends in your own home, or simply enjoying the gentle Mediterranean breeze from your terrace.",
  "investmentSection": "Beyond serving as your personal Mediterranean escape, this property represents a compelling investment. El Verger's property market has appreciated 8% year-on-year, outperforming broader Costa Blanca trends as savvy investors discover this authentic alternative to oversaturated resort towns. The typical holiday rental income of €800 per week (€41,600 annually at 65% occupancy) means your property can generate substantial returns during periods you're not using it.\n\nPriced at €3,887 per square meter against El Verger's €2,200 average, the premium specification justifies the positioning—particularly when compared to equivalent properties on Ibiza or Mallorca, where prices run 40% higher. The established international community and proven rental demand provide confidence in both capital appreciation and income potential. Whether you're seeking a second home investment, a retirement property, or a holiday rental business, the fundamentals align favorably with your ownership goals.",

    {
      "question": "Могут ли иностранцы купить недвижимость в Испании?",
      "answer": "Yes, foreign nationals can purchase property in Spain without restrictions. You'll need an NIE (Spanish tax identification number), which is straightforward to obtain through your real estate agent or local authorities. British, EU, and non-EU buyers have equal purchase rights. Legal representation through a Spanish property lawyer is highly recommended."
    },
    {
      "question": "Каковы расходы на покупку недвижимости в Испании?",
      "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, expect approximately 8-10% additional costs: 6-7% property transfer tax (ITP), 1-1.5% notary fees, legal costs (0.5-1%), and potential real estate agent fees.

      "answer": "No visa is required specifically for property purchase.

As a non-resident, you may pay income tax on rental income (19% marginal rate). Wealth tax applies to non-residents owning Spanish property valued over €600,000. For this €447,000 property, expect annual IBI around €400-500 plus rental income taxes if let."
