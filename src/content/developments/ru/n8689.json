  "metaTitle": "3 Спален Bungalow €270,000 Pilar de La Horadada Costa Blanca",
  "metaDescription": "Премиум 3-bedroom bungalow €270,000 in Pilar de La Horadada. Ideal retirement home with expat community, healthcare, and year-round sunshine. 40% less than island markets.",
  "heroIntro": "Welcome to peaceful retirement living on Spain's Costa Blanca. This exceptional 3-bedroom bungalow in Parque Ramon Eugenio Escudero offers the relaxed lifestyle you've earned, priced at just €270,000—remarkable value for a premium-specification property that costs 40% less than comparable homes on Spanish island markets. Pilar de La Horadada has become a haven for British and international retirees seeking genuine value without compromise on quality or community. This bungalow sits within an established neighbourhood where English is widely spoken, healthcare is accessible, and daily life moves at a pace that suits those ready to slow down. With 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms across 67 square metres of thoughtfully designed living space, this home offers the perfect balance of compact efficiency and comfortable living. The property represents outstanding value in a market gaining 8% annually, while the established expat community means you'll never feel isolated—yet have all the peace and privacy retirement demands.",
  "areaSection": "Pilar de La Horadada sits on the southern Costa Blanca, positioned between the vibrant tourist areas to the north and the quieter Spanish coastline to the south. This positioning offers the best of both worlds: proximity to amenities and beaches without the overwhelming tourism of major resorts. The town enjoys over 300 days of annual sunshine, with mild winters averaging 15°C and warm summers rarely exceeding 32°C—ideal for those escaping harsher climates. The area maintains an authentic Spanish character while hosting one of Spain's largest international communities. The nearby beaches are uncrowded compared to more developed coastal areas, and the landscape features the distinctive white villages and pine forests typical of inland Alicante. Local infrastructure has developed significantly, with modern healthcare facilities, shopping centres, and recreational amenities serving both Spanish residents and the growing expat population.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Pilar de La Horadada revolves around genuine relaxation and community connection. Mornings might include a coffee at a local café where you'll likely hear English, Spanish, and several other languages—the international community here is welcoming and well-established. Shopping is convenient with Mercadona, Lidl, and Consum supermarkets supplemented by traditional weekly markets offering fresh produce. The pace is noticeably slower than UK life: long lunches, afternoon paseos (walks), and evening social gatherings are the norm. Healthcare is a key comfort for retirees—English-speaking doctors and modern private clinics operate alongside the regional hospital just 30 minutes away. Beaches with Blue Flag status are within 20 minutes' drive, ideal for leisurely walks or gentle swimming. The expat community organises regular social events, bridge clubs, golf outings, and cultural activities, ensuring you're never short of companionship. Yet the beauty of this location is the freedom to be as social or solitary as you prefer—the infrastructure supports both.",
  "investmentSection": "While primarily suited to owner-occupiers seeking retirement homes, this property offers solid investment credentials. The Costa Blanca market has grown 8% year-on-year, with Pilar de La Horadada benefiting from increased demand from northern European buyers. Comparable properties in the area typically rent for €800 per week during peak season, providing optional income if you decide to let the property during your absences. At €4,030 per square metre, this property commands a premium to the local average (€2,200/m²) due to its quality specification, yet remains 40% cheaper than equivalent properties on Spanish islands like Mallorca or Ibiza. The established infrastructure, growing expat population, and improving healthcare facilities suggest continued appreciation. Whether viewed as a forever home or a long-term investment, this property offers financial stability in a stable, established market segment.",
  "conclusion": "This 3-bedroom bungalow represents more than a property purchase—it's your gateway to the retirement lifestyle you've earned. At €270,000, you're securing a premium-specification home in an established, welcoming community where English is spoken, healthcare is accessible, and daily life moves at your preferred pace. The combination of exceptional value, proven market growth, and proven community infrastructure makes this an outstanding choice for British and international retirees. Whether you're seeking full-time Mediterranean living or a flexible base for extended European stays, this property delivers genuine value without compromise. Reach out via WhatsApp to arrange a viewing or discuss your retirement plans with our specialist advisors. Your Costa Blanca future awaits.",
