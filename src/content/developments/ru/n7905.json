    {
      "question": "Могут ли иностранцы купить недвижимость в Испании?",

Professional legal representation is standard and essential for protecting your interests."
    },
    {
      "question": "Каковы расходы на покупку недвижимости в Испании?",
      "answer": "Purchase costs typically total 8-10% of property price and include: property transfer tax (6-8% depending on region), legal fees (0.6-1%), notary fees (0.3-0.5%), and registration costs. Some regions offer first-buyer reductions. Always budget for a complete property survey (€300-500) and pest inspection. These costs should be calculated before committing to your purchase."

      "question": "Сколько составляет налог на недвижимость в Испании?",
