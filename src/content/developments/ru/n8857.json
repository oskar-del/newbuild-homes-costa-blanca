  "heroIntro": "Welcome to a contemporary one-bedroom apartment in Torrevieja, located just 200 metres from the inviting waters of Playa del Acequión. This new build property offers the perfect balance between coastal living and urban convenience, situated in a carefully designed residential development of just 11 homes. With 62 square metres of thoughtfully laid-out space, this apartment represents an ideal entry point into Costa Blanca living, whether you're seeking a permanent residence, holiday retreat, or investment property.\n\nTorrevieja has evolved significantly over recent decades, transforming from a small fishing village into one of the Costa Blanca's most dynamic coastal towns. The Acequión Beach area, where this property is located, has become increasingly sought after due to its cleaner waters, excellent facilities, and strong community atmosphere. Unlike more overcrowded stretches of coastline, this neighbourhood maintains a more authentic feel whilst remaining extremely accessible.\n\nThe development's quiet setting creates a peaceful sanctuary away from tourist crowds, yet everything you need is within a short walk. The building's modern construction standards ensure energy efficiency and contemporary comfort, whilst the proximity to Torrevieja's vibrant centre means you're never far from dining, entertainment, and cultural activities.

  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's real estate market has demonstrated consistent strength, particularly in beachfront and near-beach properties. The town attracts both permanent residents seeking Mediterranean lifestyle and investors recognising the rental potential of coastal properties. Properties near quality beaches like Acequión benefit from year-round demand, with strong summer tourism season combined with growing winter interest from northern European residents seeking mild climate. This one-bedroom apartment's compact size, modern condition, and prime location make it particularly attractive for short-term holiday rentals, which command premium rates during peak seasons. The property's efficient layout and move-in ready condition minimise renovation costs, allowing investors to begin generating returns quickly.
