Located in a carefully curated boutique development of just 8 modern apartments, this property combines contemporary design with an unbeatable location—just 600 meters from the crystalline waters of Playa de Los Locos. The penthouse layout maximizes natural light and living space across its 59 square meters, making it ideal for couples, small families, or savvy investors seeking high-rental-yield properties.\n\nTorrevieja's Centro district is experiencing significant revitalization.

The area pulses with authentic Spanish culture, excellent local restaurants serving fresh Mediterranean cuisine, and a genuine mix of long-term residents and international communities. Unlike overcrowded resort towns, Torrevieja maintains its authentic character while offering modern amenities.\n\nThis specific development represents the new wave of quality residential projects in the area—thoughtfully designed modern apartments that respect the town's character rather than dominating it.
