  "metaDescription": "Просторный 3-bedroom villa in Playa Honda, Cartagena. €489,000. Perfect family home with outdoor space, near schools and beaches. 40% less than island markets.",
  "heroIntro": "Welcome to your family's next chapter in sunny Cartagena.

  "areaSection": "Cartagena is a historic port city in Murcia, southeastern Spain, where ancient Roman ruins meet modern Mediterranean living. Perched on the Costa Cálida coastline, the city benefits from year-round sunshine and mild winters that rarely dip below 10°C. Playa Honda, where this villa is located, sits on the outskirts of the city center, offering the perfect balance—close enough to access Cartagena's excellent amenities, yet peaceful and residential enough for family life. The region's geography, with protective hills and a sheltered bay, creates a particularly pleasant microclimate. Cartagena's transformation over the past two decades has made it increasingly popular with international families seeking authentic Spanish living without the tourist overcrowding of the northern Costa Blanca.",
  "lifestyleSection": "Daily life in Cartagena revolves around the Mediterranean rhythm of fresh seafood markets, family-friendly beaches, and a genuinely welcoming international community. The established expat population means English is widely spoken in schools, medical facilities, and shops, easing any transition concerns. School runs take minutes, with both international and Spanish education options available. Weekends often include trips to the stunning beaches at Playa Paraíso or Playa Real, where children can safely swim and play. The weekly mercadillos (markets) are beloved by families for fresh produce, local specialties, and social connection. Healthcare is exceptional—English-speaking doctors and modern private clinics complement the excellent regional hospital. Restaurants cater to all tastes, from traditional paella specialists to international cuisine. The cost of living remains genuinely affordable compared to northern Europe, meaning your family budget stretches further for holidays, activities, and quality time together.",
  "investmentSection": "Cartagena's property market is experiencing steady growth—prices have risen 8% year-on-year as savvy investors recognize the region's value. This villa, priced at €3,881/m², commands a premium to Cartagena's €2,200/m² average due to its premium specification and desirable location, yet remains 40% less expensive than equivalent properties on Spanish islands. The rental market is strong: families and couples typically rent similar properties for €800 per week during summer months, delivering potential annual rental income of €16,000-€20,000 if you choose to let during peak season. Many owners use a mixed strategy—living in the property during winter and renting during summer holidays, effectively reducing their cost of ownership. The combination of growing demand, limited supply of quality family homes, and the region's rising popularity with international buyers suggests solid long-term appreciation potential.",
  "conclusion": "This Playa Honda villa represents more than a property purchase—it's an investment in your family's quality of life and future security. Combining affordable Mediterranean living with professional investment potential, this home delivers genuine value in today's competitive market.
