      "answer": "Properties in Parque de las Naciones consistently achieve 5-6% annual returns from holiday rentals and 4-5% from long-term tenancies.

    },
    {
      "question": "Is Torrevieja a good place to live permanently or just for holidays?",
      "answer": "Torrevieja is genuinely suitable for permanent residence. The town has excellent healthcare facilities (three major hospitals), supermarkets including El Corte Inglés, international schools, and an established expat community from 80+ countries. The Mediterranean climate, affordable cost of living, and beach lifestyle attract permanent residents of all ages. The key is understanding you're living in a genuine Spanish town rather than a tourist resort."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the additional costs beyond the purchase price?",
      "answer": "Budget approximately 10-12% of purchase price for closing costs (notary, property registration, legal fees). Annual community fees typically run €100-150 for a 1-bedroom in this area. Property taxes (IBI) average €400-500 annually. If you plan to rent, professional management costs 20-25% of rental income. Travel insurance and utilities (electricity, water, internet) vary by usage."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the neighborhood's safety and community atmosphere?",
      "answer": "Parque de las Naciones is a well-established residential area with active community management. The neighborhood benefits from increased foot traffic due to its central location, which naturally enhances security. The area attracts mixed demographics—young professionals, families, and retirees—creating a balanced community. Property management companies maintain regular presence, and local police patrol frequently."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes this apartment better value than similar properties nearby?",
      "answer": "The combination of 2 bathrooms (rare in 1-bedroom units), central location, and new construction standards justifies competitive pricing. Many comparable 1-bed apartments in Torrevieja have only 1 bathroom, limiting their appeal for couples and reducing rental flexibility. The modern build minimizes unexpected maintenance—older renovated properties frequently require costly repairs within 5 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this property part-year and rent it the remainder?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Many owners occupy their apartments 2-4 months yearly and generate rental income the rest of the year. This 'hybrid' approach is popular in Torrevieja and provides an excellent work-life balance. You'll need to establish clear rental management protocols, ensure adequate property maintenance between your stays, and understand Spanish tax implications for mixed-use properties. Professional property managers can coordinate this seamlessly."
