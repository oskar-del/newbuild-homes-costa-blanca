  "areaSection": "Javea, nestled on the Costa Blanca's northern coast, is characterized by its dramatic clifftop geography, crystalline Mediterranean waters, and year-round temperate climate averaging 300 days of sunshine. The municipality encompasses three distinct nuclei—the Port, the Old Town, and the mountainous interior—creating diverse residential environments while maintaining authentic Iberian charm. Positioned between Valencia and Alicante, Javea benefits from relative isolation that preserves its exclusive character. The surrounding terrain features protected natural areas, including the Montgo Nature Reserve, which frames the coastline with striking geological formations. The region's Mediterranean climate, with warm summers and mild winters, supports an outdoor-centric lifestyle. Javea's appeal transcends tourism; it has evolved into a substantial residential destination for affluent Europeans seeking permanent or semi-permanent Mediterranean living without the ostentation of larger resort cities.",
