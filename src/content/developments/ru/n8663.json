You can structure payment through Spanish mortgages (available to foreign buyers) or cash purchase with straightforward legal processes handled by your solicitor."
    },
    {
      "question": "Могут ли иностранцы купить недвижимость в Испании?",

For this €259,000 property, expect total acquisition costs of approximately €18,000-€26,000.
