      "answer": "Properties like this penthouse in Finestrat typically command €700-€900 per week during peak season (June-September), with shoulder season rates of €500-€700 (April-May, October-November). Conservative estimates of 8-10 weeks annual rental generate €12,000-€16,000 income. Many owners achieve higher returns with professional management companies handling bookings and maintenance.
