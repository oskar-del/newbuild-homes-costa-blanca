    "metaDescription": "Discover Vera, Costa Blanca: New build properties €187,950-€539,000. Beach town living with Mediterranean climate, expat community, and investment opportunities.",
    "heroIntro": "Vera is a charming coastal town located on the eastern edge of Almería province in the Costa Blanca region of southeastern Spain. This authentic Mediterranean gem has evolved from a quiet fishing village into a vibrant residential destination while maintaining its traditional character and relaxed lifestyle. With 21 new build properties currently available ranging from €187,950 to €539,000, Vera offers exceptional value compared to other Costa Blanca hotspots. The town combines the appeal of pristine beaches, genuine Spanish culture, and modern amenities, making it increasingly popular with international buyers seeking authentic Mediterranean living without the overcrowding of more famous coastal areas.\n\nVera's strategic location provides easy access to major amenities while preserving its peaceful, unhurried atmosphere. The town boasts a thriving expat community that has integrated seamlessly with local Spanish residents, creating a welcoming and cosmopolitan environment. Whether you're seeking a holiday retreat, permanent residence, or investment property, Vera delivers remarkable value and quality of life that appeals to families, retirees, and young professionals alike.\n\nThe new build market in Vera features diverse property types including modern apartments, spacious villas, luxury penthouses, and practical bungalows.

    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Daily life in Vera revolves around the quintessential Spanish Mediterranean rhythm. The town maintains authentic charm with traditional tapas bars, family-run restaurants, and a genuine local community that hasn't been entirely overtaken by tourism. Mornings often see locals enjoying café con leche at neighborhood bars, while evenings bring the traditional paseo (evening stroll) along the seafront. The expat community in Vera is well-established but manageable in size, creating a supportive network without overwhelming local culture. Newcomers find it easy to integrate, with numerous social groups, hobby clubs, and community organizations facilitating friendships across both international and Spanish residents.\n\nThe town's atmosphere balances tranquility with sufficient amenities and social opportunities. You'll find book clubs, walking groups, yoga classes, and Spanish language courses catering to expats, yet the environment remains distinctly Spanish rather than being a transplanted foreign enclave. Local markets, beach activities, and seasonal festivals provide ongoing cultural engagement. The pedestrian-friendly town center encourages daily interaction with neighbors, while the beach and surrounding countryside offer abundant recreation. This balanced lifestyle attracts those seeking relaxation without boredom, cultural authenticity with international community support.\n\nVera enjoys one of Spain's most enviable climates with over 320 days of sunshine annually. The town experiences Mediterranean weather characterized by warm, dry summers averaging 28-30°C and mild winters with temperatures rarely dropping below 10°C. The nearby Mojacar headland helps shield Vera from cold northern winds, creating a particularly pleasant microclimate. Rainfall is minimal, particularly from June through September, making outdoor activities enjoyable throughout most of the year. The sea temperature ranges from 15°C in winter to 26°C in summer, perfect for swimming from May to October.",

      "beaches": "Vera's 7km of beautiful beaches provide swimming, paddleboarding, kayaking, and windsurfing opportunities, particularly excellent from May through October. The promenade supports walking and cycling paths perfect for daily exercise and family outings. Three 18-hole golf courses operate within 30km, including Palacio Golf (20km) and Desert Springs Golf (35km).

      "dining": "Vera's culinary scene celebrates fresh seafood and traditional Spanish cuisine. The seafront paseo features numerous chiringuitos (beach bars) serving paella, espetos (grilled fish), and tapas with sea views. The town center contains family-run restaurants offering authentic Spanish dishes at reasonable prices, particularly in the maze of streets near the Plaza Mayor. Italian, international, and vegetarian restaurants serve the diverse community. Local specialties include gazpacho, espetos, caldillo de pez (fish stew), and fresh Mediterranean seafood. The town's fishing heritage ensures restaurant-quality fish reaches local tables daily. Weekly markets provide ingredients for home cooking, while cooking classes offer opportunities to learn Spanish culinary traditions.",
      "shopping": "Vera's town center features traditional Spanish shops including bakeries, butchers, fishmongers, and greengrocers offering local products. The weekly market (typically Thursday and Sunday) provides fresh produce, clothing, and household goods at excellent prices. For larger shopping needs, the Carrefour and other supermarkets stock international products alongside Spanish brands. Nearby Mojacar (10km) offers additional shopping options including boutiques and specialty stores. For extensive shopping, Almería city (45km) provides major shopping centers like Centro Comercial Torrecárdenas and traditional retail districts.",
      "healthcare": "Vera is served by the Centro de Salud (health center) providing general medical services and primary care. For specialized treatment and hospital facilities, residents typically access the Hospital Torrecárdenas in nearby Almería, approximately 45km away, which offers comprehensive medical services including emergency departments. Many residents also utilize private healthcare clinics in the region for faster access to specialists. Pharmacies are readily available throughout town, with English-speaking staff common in tourist areas. European residents benefit from Spanish healthcare system access through reciprocal agreements and private insurance options.",
      "transport": "Almería-Levante Airport (LEI) is the nearest major airport, approximately 55km south, serving European destinations with numerous budget airline connections. Málaga-Costa del Sol Airport (AGP) is 150km to the west, offering more flight options and international connections. Both airports provide car rental services with drive times of 1-2 hours to Vera. Additionally, Granada-Jaén Airport (GRX) offers an alternative approximately 180km away. Most residents utilize the closer Almería or Málaga airports for European travel. Vera benefits from modern road infrastructure with direct motorway access via the A-7 (Autovía del Mediterráneo) connecting to Almería (45km), Málaga (150km), and Granada (200km). The N-340 provides an alternative scenic coastal route. Local roads are well-maintained and clearly signposted. Most destinations on the Costa Blanca are accessible within 1-3 hours by car. The town center is navigable by car, though the seafront promenade is pedestrianized. Parking is available throughout town, with both street parking and dedicated car parks. Local buses (ALSA and regional services) connect Vera to Almería, Mojacar, and surrounding towns with regular daily service. The regional bus station provides connections to larger cities. However, public transport is limited compared to major urban areas, making car ownership advisable for full mobility and flexibility. Taxis are available but expensive for frequent use. The town's compact size makes walking viable for daily errands, while cycling has become increasingly popular with improved infrastructure. For long-distance travel, coaches provide affordable connections to major Spanish cities."

    "propertyMarketSection": "Vera's property market offers exceptional value within the Costa Blanca region. With 21 new build properties currently available, the market shows healthy development activity without oversupply.
