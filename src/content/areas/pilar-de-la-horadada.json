    "quickAnswer": "Pilar de la Horadada is the southern gateway to Costa Blanca, featuring the Jack Nicklaus-designed Lo Romero Golf and beautiful Mil Palmeras beaches. Properties range from €169,000 apartments to €750,000 golf villas. Just 20 minutes from Murcia Airport, it's where Costa Blanca meets Costa Cálida.",
    "heroIntro": "At the southern edge of Costa Blanca, where the province of Alicante yields to Murcia, lies a town that refuses to choose between identities. Pilar de la Horadada has the authentic Spanish character of an agricultural community, the resort appeal of its coastal urbanizations like Mil Palmeras, and the sporting prestige of Lo Romero Golf—a Jack Nicklaus signature course that alone would make this area worth attention.\n\nThis is where Costa Blanca meets Costa Cálida, literally and figuratively. The Mar Menor lagoon is just across the regional border. Murcia Airport is closer than Alicante. The area draws from both regions' strengths while maintaining its own distinct character: genuine Spanish life with international resort development, championship golf with natural beaches, agricultural heritage with modern convenience.\n\nFor buyers seeking value at the edge of Costa Blanca's established markets, Pilar de la Horadada offers undiscovered potential.",
    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Life in Pilar de la Horadada varies dramatically depending on where you settle. The town center offers authentic Spanish life—markets, fiestas, tapas bars, and neighbors who've lived here for generations. The coastal urbanizations like Mil Palmeras provide resort-style living with beaches, modern developments, and an international community. And Lo Romero Golf creates its own world of fairway homes and clubhouse culture.\n\nThis diversity is part of the appeal. You can choose your lifestyle—Spanish immersion, resort convenience, golf focus—or blend them according to preference. The area hasn't been homogenized by mass tourism like some neighbors, preserving options.",
