LTV (loan-to-value) ratios are generally 60-80%, and interest rates are competitive with Northern Europe. Many international buyers find that securing Spanish mortgages alongside or instead of UK mortgages can optimize financing strategies. It's advisable to consult with Spanish mortgage brokers who understand international buyer requirements."
