    "quickAnswer": "Villamartin is the golf capital of Costa Blanca South, built around the famous Villamartin Golf Club (est. 1972). Properties range from €185,000 apartments to €750,000 villas, with 5 championship courses within 15 minutes. The famous Villamartin Plaza is the social heart of the expat community.",
    "heroIntro": "There's a moment every morning in Villamartin when the sun hits the first fairway, the sprinklers dance across manicured greens, and the early groups appear on the horizon. This isn't just a place where people play golf—it's a place built entirely around the game.\n\nVillamartin was created in the early 1970s with a vision that was ahead of its time: design a community where golf is woven into the fabric of daily life. Half a century later, that vision has matured into one of Costa Blanca's most desirable addresses. The championship course that gives the area its name is surrounded by low-rise villas, townhouses, and apartments, many with direct fairway views. The famous Villamartin Plaza buzzes with life every evening, its restaurants and bars the gathering point for a community that spans dozens of nationalities.",
    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Living in Villamartin means golf is always within reach, but life here is about far more than the game. The Plaza is the social epicenter—a purpose-built square surrounded by restaurants, bars, and cafés where the community gathers every evening. On any given night, you'll hear a dozen languages, though English predominates. Friendships form quickly here.\n\nThe day typically starts with coffee at your favorite terrace, perhaps a round at one of the five courses within 15 minutes, lunch at the clubhouse, and evenings back at the Plaza watching the world go by. It's a rhythm that attracts retirees, remote workers, and anyone who dreamed of making golf a lifestyle rather than a hobby.",
