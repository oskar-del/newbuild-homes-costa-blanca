    "quickAnswer": "Benijófar is a small authentic Spanish village surrounded by citrus groves offering modern villas from €165,000. Guardamar beaches are just 6 km away, La Finca Golf 7 minutes. Perfect for buyers seeking village life with coastal convenience—real Spain at affordable prices.",
    "heroIntro": "Benijófar is the kind of Spanish village that postcards try to capture: whitewashed houses clustered around a church tower, orange groves perfuming the air in spring, elderly locals gathering in the plaza as they have for generations. Yet this isn't a museum piece—it's a living community where new villas with pools sit alongside traditional homes, and international buyers are welcomed into genuine village life.\n\nThe village occupies a gentle rise in the Vega Baja agricultural region, surrounded by the citrus groves that have sustained the area for centuries. Guardamar's natural beaches are just 6 km away. La Finca Golf is 7 minutes. Torrevieja's amenities are 12 minutes. Yet the pace of life here is unmistakably village—slower, friendlier, more connected to the rhythms of Spanish life.\n\nFor buyers seeking authenticity without isolation, Benijófar offers a rare balance.",
    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Village life in Benijófar means knowing your neighbors, stopping for coffee at the local bar, and participating in fiestas that have run for generations. The international community is present but integrates rather than dominates. Spanish is useful and appreciated. Those who embrace village life find warmth that resort living can't replicate.\n\nThe surrounding modern urbanizations offer new villas with pools and contemporary comforts. Residents get the best of both: village character for daily life, modern home comforts, and coastal amenities minutes away.",

      {
        "question": "How does Benijófar compare to larger towns?",

      }
    ],
    "conclusion": "Benijófar offers something increasingly precious: genuine Spanish village life that hasn't been transformed by mass tourism. The whitewashed houses, the citrus groves, the fiestas—these are authentic, not recreated. Yet modern villas nearby offer contemporary comfort, and beaches are closer than many coastal developments.\n\nFor buyers seeking village integration with convenience nearby, Benijófar delivers both.\n\nReady to explore properties in Benijófar? Our team understands village living and can match you with properties that suit your integration goals—from village center townhouses to modern urbanization villas."
