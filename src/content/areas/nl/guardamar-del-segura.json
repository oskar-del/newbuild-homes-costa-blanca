    "metaDescription": "Volledige gids voor wonen in Guardamar del Segura - family-vriendelijk Costa Blanca South. Stranden, golf, internationale gemeenschap. Nieuwbouw vanaf €200.000.",
    "quickAnswer": "Guardamar del Segura offers Costa Blanca's most natural setting—protected dune system, pine forests, and 11 km of beaches. Properties start at €175,000 for apartments, €250,000 for townhouses, and €350,000 for villas. Just 28 minuutn from Alicante Airport, it's the closest major resort to the airport.",
    "heroIntro": "Where the River Segura meets the Mediterranean, a remarkable landscape unfolds. Protected dunes rise behind pristine beaches, blanketed by the pine forests that generations of local residents planted to hold back the advancing sands. This is Guardamar del Segura—a town that feels different from anywhere else on Costa Blanca.\n\nThe story of Guardamar is one of human tenacity. In the late 1800s, engineers led by Francisco Mira y Botella began an ambitious project to stabilize the dunes that threatened to engulf the town. They planted over 600,000 pine trees, creating the unique landscape that defines Guardamar today. Those forests now provide shade for walking trails, the dunes are protected natural habitat, and the beaches stretch for 11 kilometers with an intimacy that mass tourism hasn't discovered.\n\nFor buyers seeking nature alongside their Mediterranean home, Guardamar offers something truly special.",
    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Life in Guardamar revolves around the outdoors. Morning walks through the pine forests, swimming in waters that feel cleaner than anywhere on the coast, cycling along the river paths, watching flamingos at the nearby salt lakes. This is a town for those who value nature as much as sunshine.\n\nThe town itself is authentic Spanish—weekly markets, traditional tapas bars, festivals that have run for generations. The international community is present but smaller than Orihuela Costa, meaning more genuine integration with Spanish life. English is spoken in tourist areas but Spanish helps here more than elsewhere.",

Playa de la Roqueta and Playa del Moncayo stretch between the dunes with golden sand and smaller crowds. For true nature lovers, Les Ortigues is a protected natural beach within the dune system—no development, just pristine Mediterranean coast.",
      "dining": "The town center has excellent traditional Spanish restaurants—fresh fish, paella, tapas. The paseo (promenade) offers seaside dining with sunset views. International options are fewer than Orihuela Costa but quality is high. Wednesday market days bring special atmosphere with outdoor cafés buzzing. For variety, Torrevieja (10 km) and La Zenia (15 km) are close.",
      "shopping": "Guardamar has a good selection of local shops, supermarkets, and pharmacies in the town center. The Wednesday market is a highlight—traditional Spanish market with fresh produce, fish, clothing, and household goods. Sunday's flea market at El Raso draws bargain hunters.

      "healthcare": "Hospital Universitario de Torrevieja is 10 km away (12 minuutn), with comprehensive services and English-speaking staff. Local medical centers and pharmacies serve the town. Private clinics in Torrevieja offer additional options. The healthcare infrastructure is excellent for the size of the town.",
      "transport": "Alicante-Elche Airport is just 35 km away (28 minuutn)—the closest of any major Costa Blanca resort. This is a genuine advantage for frequent travelers. Murcia-Corvera Airport is 50 km (40 minuutn). A car is recommended as public transport is limited. The N-332 coastal road and AP-7 motorway provide good connections."
