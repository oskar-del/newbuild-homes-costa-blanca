        "question": "Can foreigners buy property in Spain?",
        "answer": "Yes, foreigners can freely buy property in Spain without restrictions. EU citizens, non-EU citizens, and those without Spanish residency all have equal rights to purchase residential or commercial property. You'll need a Spanish tax identification number (NIE) and a Spanish bank account for the transaction. Legal assistance from an English-speaking gestor (legal advisor) is recommended to navigate the purchase process smoothly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the costs of buying property in Spain?",
        "answer": "Beyond the property purchase price, expect additional costs totaling 8-12% of the property value. These include: transfer tax (6-10% depending on region), notary fees (0.5-1%), legal fees (1-2%), and registration fees (0.5%). For Los Alcazares properties ranging €260,000-€1,390,000, budget accordingly. Hiring a gestor helps identify all costs specific to your transaction."

EU citizens can register as residents. Non-EU citizens need a visa depending on their nationality and intended length of stay.
