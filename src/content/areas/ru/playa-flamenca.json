Just 5 minutes from Villamartin Golf and 10 minutes from hospital. Practical beach living.",
    "heroIntro": "Между оживлением La Zenia и более тихими местами Punta Prima лежит Playa Flamenca — сообщество, которое практически, а не претенциозно подходит к прибрежной жизни. Пляж здесь имеет спокойные мелкие воды, которые ценят родители, мягкий склон песка, который нравится детям, и достаточно места, чтобы летние толпы не казались подавляющими.\n\nСекрет Playa Flamenca — его практичность. La Zenia Boulevard находится в 2 км — достаточно близко для удобного шоппинга, достаточно далеко, чтобы район сохранял свой жилой характер. Гольф-клуб Villamartin находится в 5 минутах. Больница находится в 10 минутах. Цены обычно на 10-15% ниже, чем в La Zenia, предлагая аналогичный доступ к пляжу и лучшую близость к гольфу.\n\nДля покупателей, ищущих ценность, удобство для семей и практическое удобство без премиальных цен, Playa Flamenca предоставляет необходимое.",
    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Life in Playa Flamenca is comfortably suburban-coastal. Morning beach walks, school runs (good international options nearby), shopping at the Boulevard, evening barbecues. It's less glamorous than Cabo Roig, less commercial than La Zenia, less pretentious than Campoamor. It's practical—and for many, that's exactly right.\n\nThe community is established and family-oriented, with British, Scandinavian, and other European residents. English is widely spoken. Integration happens through children's activities, golf clubs, and the natural community of beach life. It's welcoming without being overwhelming.",
