    "heroIntro": "Moraira is an exclusive fishing village that has evolved into one of Costa Blanca's most desirable residential addresses. Part of the Teulada-Moraira municipality, this intimate coastal community offers a refined lifestyle that attracts discerning buyers seeking privacy, quality, and authentic Mediterranean charm.\n\nUnlike larger coastal towns, Moraira has deliberately limited development to preserve its village character. The result is an upmarket enclave where whitewashed villas dot the hillsides, a picturesque marina shelters luxury yachts, and traditional Spanish life continues in the charming center.",
    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Life in Moraira revolves around the sea, good food, and relaxed outdoor living. The village center, clustered around a 14th-century watchtower and small fishing port, retains genuine Spanish character with traditional tapas bars, weekly markets, and local fiestas.\n\nThe international community—primarily British, German, Swiss, and Dutch—is well-established but integrated. You'll find excellent restaurants, boutique shopping, and active social clubs while still experiencing authentic Spanish culture.",
      "highlights": [
        "Exclusive village atmosphere with limited development",
        "Beautiful beaches including the sheltered Portet bay",
        "Active marina with sailing and water sports",
        "Excellent restaurants from beach chiringuitos to fine dining",
        "Weekly Wednesday market with local produce and crafts",
        "Safe, quiet environment ideal for families and retirees",
        "Strong sense of community among residents",
        "Easy access to Jávea, Calpe, and larger towns"

    },
    "amenitiesSection": {
      "beaches": "Moraira has several beautiful beaches and coves. Playa de l'Ampolla in the center offers calm waters and beachfront dining. El Portet is a stunning horseshoe bay—one of the prettiest on the coast—perfect for families and snorkeling. Cap Blanc and other rocky coves offer secluded swimming in crystal-clear water.",
      "dining": "Despite its small size, Moraira punches above its weight gastronomically. Fresh seafood is exceptional—try the local prawns or catch of the day at waterfront restaurants. The village center has traditional Spanish tapas bars, while international cuisines are well-represented. Several restaurants are highly rated.",
      "shopping": "Moraira's center has boutique shops, galleries, and daily essentials. The Wednesday market is a highlight, with fresh produce, flowers, clothing, and local crafts. For larger shopping, Ondara (25 min) has a retail park with major stores, and Jávea (15 min) offers more variety.",
      "healthcare": "Hospital de Dénia (Marina Salud) is the nearest major hospital, about 20 km away with English-speaking staff. Moraira has medical centers, private clinics, dentists, and well-stocked pharmacies. Private health insurance is popular among expats for comprehensive coverage.",
      "transport": "Alicante-Elche Airport is 85 km (approximately 55 minutes) via the AP-7 motorway. Valencia Airport is 120 km. A car is essential in Moraira as public transport is limited. The village is compact and walkable, but accessing beaches and amenities requires driving."
    },
    "propertyMarketSection": "Moraira's property market is characterized by exclusivity and quality. Strict planning controls have limited high-rise development, resulting in a landscape of individual villas, many with sea views. This scarcity maintains strong property values.\n\nNew build villas typically start around €800,000 for contemporary 3-bedroom homes, with premium sea-view properties ranging €1.5-3 million. Buyers are typically seeking lifestyle properties—permanent homes or high-end holiday residences—rather than investment rentals.\n\nThe hillside areas of Cumbre del Sol (technically in neighboring Benitachell), El Portet, and Cap Blanc are particularly sought-after for their views. Properties sell to a quality-focused international clientele willing to pay for the Moraira lifestyle.",
