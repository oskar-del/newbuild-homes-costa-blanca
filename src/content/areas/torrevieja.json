With over 80,000 residents representing 100+ nationalities, this is a town that truly embraces diversity while maintaining its Spanish character.\n\nThe town is famous for its two stunning salt lakes—the pink Laguna Rosa and the green Laguna de Torrevieja—which create a unique microclimate with exceptionally clean air. The World Health Organization has recognized Torrevieja as having one of the healthiest climates in Europe, with over 300 sunny days annually and mild winters averaging 16-18°C.",

      "intro": "Life in Torrevieja offers the best of both worlds: authentic Spanish culture with the convenience of a large international community. The famous Friday market is one of Spain's largest, stretching over 2 km with hundreds of stalls. The seafront promenade buzzes with activity year-round, lined with restaurants, cafés, and traditional tapas bars.\n\nThe town maintains a genuine Spanish atmosphere despite its international population. You'll find traditional fiestas throughout the year, including the famous Habaneras choral music festival in August.",
