    "quickAnswer": "San Fulgencio is an inland Spanish town while La Marina is its coastal urbanization with unspoiled dune-backed beaches. Just 20 minutes from Alicante Airport—the closest residential area to the airport. Properties from €159,000 for apartments, €275,000 for villas. Strong expat community with nature on your doorstep.",
    "heroIntro": "Two personalities, one municipality. San Fulgencio is the traditional Spanish heart—a hillside town with church bells, narrow streets, and an authenticity that coastal resorts can only imitate. La Marina is the soul—a beachfront urbanization where golden sand meets protected dunes, where flamingos wade in nearby salt marshes, and where one of Costa Blanca's most unspoiled coastlines stretches in both directions.\n\nWhat makes this area unique is its proximity to Alicante Airport—just 20 minutes door-to-door. For frequent travelers, weekend visitors, or those who simply value easy connections, this accessibility is unmatched on the southern Costa Blanca. Yet despite this convenience, the beaches here remain remarkably natural, the dunes still wild, the development low-rise and respectful.\n\nFor buyers seeking natural beauty, airport convenience, and established community—all without the premium prices of better-known resorts—San Fulgencio and La Marina offer a compelling combination.",
    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Life here splits between the beach and the town. La Marina offers long morning walks on pristine sand, afternoons by the pool, and evenings at beachfront restaurants watching the sun set over the dunes. San Fulgencio provides Spanish authenticity—the Tuesday market bustling with local produce, tapas bars where Spanish mingles with English and German, a church square where village life continues as it has for generations.\n\nThe expat community is well-established—particularly British, German, and Scandinavian residents who discovered this area decades ago. Clubs, activities, and social groups abound. English is widely spoken in La Marina, while Spanish dominates in the town. Most residents appreciate having both options.",
