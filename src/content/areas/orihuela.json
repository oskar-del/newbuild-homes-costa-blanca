      "intro": "Daily life in Orihuela seamlessly blends Spanish tradition with international convenience. Mornings often begin at local markets—vibrant, authentic experiences where vendors sell fresh produce, regional specialties, and seasonal delicacies. The established international community means English is commonly spoken in shops, restaurants, and social venues, easing daily interactions for newcomers. Afternoons frequently involve leisurely meals at family-run restaurants serving traditional paella, fresh seafood, and tapas alongside international cuisine options. Weekends typically include beach excursions to nearby Blue Flag beaches or rounds at championship golf courses scattered throughout the region. The town hosts regular fiestas and cultural events celebrating Spanish heritage, while English-language social clubs and international groups provide easy community connection. Shopping ranges from traditional markets to modern supermarkets offering both Spanish and familiar international products. The pace is distinctly Mediterranean—less frenetic than coastal resorts yet more developed than remote villages. Sports enthusiasts enjoy year-round activities: golf, water sports, hiking, and cycling. The expat community has created infrastructure making integration smooth: English-speaking services, international schools, and social networks facilitate genuine connections between newcomers and established residents.\n\nOrihuela enjoys a Mediterranean climate characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters—perfect for year-round outdoor living. Summer temperatures typically reach 28-32°C (82-90°F), with coastal breezes moderating intensity, while winters remain pleasantly mild at 10-15°C (50-59°F). Rainfall concentrates in autumn and spring, with approximately 300 days of sunshine annually. The best time to experience Orihuela is April-June and September-October, when temperatures are ideal and crowds minimal. Even winter months attract visitors and residents seeking respite from northern European climates. The consistent weather patterns support an active outdoor lifestyle: beach days remain viable November through March, while gardening and outdoor activities flourish year-round. This climate stability particularly appeals to retirees and those with health sensitivities, as temperature extremes are rare. The dry, sunny conditions also contribute to property maintenance ease and reduced energy costs compared to cooler climates.",
