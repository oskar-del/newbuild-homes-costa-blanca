        "answer": "Yes, foreigners can freely buy property in Spain without citizenship or residence requirements.

        "question": "What are the costs of buying property in Spain?",
        "answer": "Purchase costs in Spain typically total 8-12% of property price, including: transfer tax (6-10%, varying by region), legal fees (1-1.5%), notary fees (0.5-1%), and agency commission (3-5% if using a realtor). Additionally, annual costs include property tax (0.4-1.1% of cadastral value) and optional home insurance. Mazarron's lower property prices mean these percentage-based costs remain very reasonable compared to developed nations."

        "answer": "No, you do not need a visa specifically to buy property in Spain. EU citizens can purchase freely with just a Spanish tax number (NIF).
