    "quickAnswer": "Ciudad Quesada is an established expat community built around La Marquesa Golf, offering excellent value properties from €165,000 apartments to €700,000 golf villas. It's 10-15 minutes from beaches, 10 minutes from Torrevieja hospital, and has 5 golf courses within 22 minutes. Perfect for golf-focused buyers seeking value.",
    "heroIntro": "Sometimes the best-kept secrets are the ones hidden in plain sight. Ciudad Quesada sits just inland from the Costa Blanca coastline, quietly offering what many buyers search for: a genuine golf lifestyle community with excellent value, proper infrastructure, and a welcoming international population—without the premium prices of beachfront locations.\n\nThe town grew around La Marquesa Golf, and that DNA remains. Golfers are everywhere, the clubhouse is a social hub, and properties with course views command respect if not the crazy premiums you'd pay elsewhere. But Ciudad Quesada has evolved beyond golf into a complete community with shops, restaurants, healthcare, and everything needed for comfortable daily life.\n\nFor buyers who prioritize lifestyle over location snobbery—and savings of 25-35% versus coastal equivalents—Ciudad Quesada rewards investigation.",
    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Daily life in Ciudad Quesada has a comfortable rhythm. Morning coffee at your local café, a round at La Marquesa or one of the nearby courses, lunch at the clubhouse or a local restaurant, afternoon by the pool, and evening drinks at one of the many bars where everyone knows your name. It's relaxed, social, and affordable.\n\nThe community is predominantly international—British, Scandinavian, Dutch, German—with English spoken everywhere. Social clubs and activities abound: golf societies, walking groups, charitable organizations, book clubs. Making friends is easy because everyone was new once. The beaches are 10-15 minutes away when you want them, but the pool and the patio often win.",

A car is essential for Ciudad Quesada—while local services are walkable, beaches and major shopping require transport. The location is actually well-positioned for exploring the region."
