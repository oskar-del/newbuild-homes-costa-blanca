    "quickAnswer": "San Miguel de Salinas is an authentic Spanish agricultural town offering excellent value properties from €155,000, surrounded by citrus groves and 8 minutes from Las Colinas Golf (Spain's top-10 course). Beaches are 8-12 minutes away. Perfect for buyers seeking real Spanish life at 30-40% less than coastal prices.",
    "heroIntro": "There's a moment on Wednesday mornings in San Miguel de Salinas when the town comes alive in a way that tourist resorts can only imitate. The market fills the streets with stalls of oranges picked that morning from surrounding groves, vegetables still dirty from the fields, fish brought up from the coast. Neighbors greet each other in Spanish, stopping for café con leche at bars where prices haven't changed in years. This is the real Spain.\n\nSan Miguel de Salinas sits in the heart of the Vega Baja agricultural region, surrounded by the citrus groves that have sustained the area for generations. It's a working Spanish town—not a resort creation—where life continues much as it has for decades. Yet Las Colinas Golf (one of Spain's top-10 courses) is 8 minutes away, beaches are 10 minutes, and the savings compared to coastal equivalents run 30-40%.\n\nFor buyers seeking authenticity alongside value, San Miguel rewards those willing to look beyond the obvious.",
    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Life in San Miguel de Salinas moves to a Spanish rhythm. The morning market and café culture, the afternoon siesta when the town goes quiet, the evening paseo when everyone emerges to walk and socialize. This isn't manufactured for tourists—it's how people actually live here.\n\nThe international community exists but integrates more than dominates. Spanish is more useful here than in coastal areas. Those who embrace this find genuine friendships with locals and a depth of experience that resort living can't match. Those who want English everywhere may find it challenging. Choose accordingly.",

For major shopping, La Zenia Boulevard (12 km) offers 150+ stores. The town is self-sufficient for daily needs while larger options are close.",

      {
        "question": "Is English widely spoken in San Miguel de Salinas?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Is San Miguel de Salinas good for golf?",
        "answer": "Excellent access. Las Colinas Golf (one of Spain's top-10 courses) is just 8 minutes away. Campoamor (10 min), Las Ramblas (12 min), and Villamartin (15 min) add variety. Great golf without golf-community prices."

      {
        "question": "What is the cost of living in San Miguel de Salinas?",

      {
        "question": "Is San Miguel de Salinas suitable for permanent living?",

        "question": "How does San Miguel compare to Torrevieja?",
        "answer": "San Miguel is smaller, more Spanish, and more affordable. Torrevieja is larger with more international amenities but higher prices. San Miguel offers authenticity; Torrevieja offers convenience. They're 12 km apart—easy to access Torrevieja's services from San Miguel."

      {
        "question": "What is the rental potential in San Miguel de Salinas?",

    ],
    "conclusion": "San Miguel de Salinas isn't for everyone—and that's precisely the point. This is authentic Spain, not a sanitized resort version. The value is exceptional, the golf access excellent, the beaches accessible. But it requires comfort with Spanish life, acceptance of less English, and appreciation for what's genuine over what's convenient.\n\nFor the right buyer, San Miguel offers a quality of life that coastal premiums can't buy. The savings go toward better properties, more golf, and experiences that tourists never find.\n\nReady to explore properties in San Miguel de Salinas?
