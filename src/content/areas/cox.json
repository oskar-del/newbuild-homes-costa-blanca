        "question": "Can foreigners buy property in Spain?",
        "answer": "Yes, foreigners can freely purchase property in Spain without restrictions. EU citizens, non-EU citizens, and those without Spanish residency can all buy property. The process involves opening a Spanish bank account, obtaining a Spanish tax identification number (NIE), and registering the purchase with local authorities. Many international real estate professionals and English-speaking solicitors in the Cox area facilitate this process for foreign buyers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the costs of buying property in Spain?",
        "answer": "Property costs in Cox range from €209,000 to €255,000, making it significantly affordable compared to other Spanish markets. Beyond the purchase price, buyers should budget for transfer tax (7-10%), legal fees (0.5-1.5% of property value), and registration costs (0.1-0.5%).

Working with English-speaking mortgage brokers in the Cox area simplifies this process, and many foreigners successfully finance property purchases through Spanish banks."
