    "quickAnswer": "Punta Prima is the northern gateway to Orihuela Costa, featuring a stunning Blue Flag beach and proximity to Torrevieja (5 min). Properties start at €175,000 for apartments, with sea-view penthouses and villas to €650,000. Just 8 minutes to Torrevieja hospital, 38 min to Alicante Airport.",
    "heroIntro": "Where Torrevieja ends and Orihuela Costa begins, Punta Prima emerges as a beachfront community that distills coastal living to its essence. The beach here is exceptional—Blue Flag certified, with that particular turquoise that comes from the right combination of sand, depth, and Mediterranean clarity. It's the beach that appears in photos when people imagine Spanish coastal life.\n\nPunta Prima's northern position gives it advantages: Torrevieja's full amenities are just 5 minutes away, the university hospital 8 minutes. Yet it belongs to the Orihuela Costa community, sharing the resort infrastructure and international atmosphere. This gateway position—connected to both, distinct from each—defines its appeal.\n\nFor buyers seeking pure beachfront lifestyle with practical access to services, Punta Prima delivers without compromise.",
    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Life in Punta Prima centers on the beach. Morning swims before the crowds arrive. Afternoon lounging on sand that's quality enough to attract visitors from across the region. Sunset drinks at beachfront chiringuitos. The rhythm is simple, the rewards immediate.\n\nThe community is established and international, with the friendliness that comes from shared appreciation of location. Golf is accessible but secondary—this is beach country first. Torrevieja's shops, restaurants, and services provide everything needed without Punta Prima becoming anything but beachfront.",
