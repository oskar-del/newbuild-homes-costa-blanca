Properties start at €149,000 for apartments, €280,000 for villas with pools. Just 8 minutes from La Finca Golf and 10 minutes from beaches, it offers nature and value in equal measure.",
    "heroIntro": "From certain vantage points in Los Montesinos, the view is unlike anywhere else on Costa Blanca: the shimmering expanse of the salt lakes—one pink, one green—stretching to the horizon with flamingos wading in the shallows. This protected natural park sits literally on the town's doorstep, a daily reminder that this corner of Spain is something special.\n\nLos Montesinos itself is a quiet Spanish town that has grown to accommodate international residents seeking space, value, and connection to nature. It lacks the bustle of coastal resorts—and for many, that's precisely the appeal. Here, mornings might involve watching flamingos from your terrace, afternoons at one of the nearby golf courses, and evenings with the windows open to air that carries a hint of the sea.\n\nFor buyers who prioritize nature and tranquility alongside excellent value, Los Montesinos offers a distinctive proposition.",

Beaches and golf are minutes away when you want them; peace and nature are constants.\n\nThe international community is present but smaller than in larger towns. Integration with Spanish life is more natural here. Those seeking nightlife and shopping convenience should look elsewhere; those seeking space, nature, and value find exactly what they're looking for.",
