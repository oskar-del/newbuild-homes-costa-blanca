    "metaDescription": "Complete guide to Cabo Roig—charming harbor, rocky coves, famous Saturday market. Properties from €210k. Traditional Mediterranean character on Costa Blanca South.",
    "quickAnswer": "Cabo Roig is Costa Blanca South's most characterful coastal village, with a charming harbor, crystal-clear rocky coves (Cala Capitán), and the famous Saturday market. Properties start at €210,000 for apartments, €280,000 for townhouses, and €450,000 for villas. It's 5-12 minutes from 4 championship golf courses.",
    "heroIntro": "If you've ever dreamed of the authentic Mediterranean—fishing boats bobbing in a small harbor, crystal-clear coves carved into the coastline, fresh seafood served as the sun sets over the sea—Cabo Roig is where that dream becomes reality.\n\nThis small coastal enclave on Orihuela Costa has somehow preserved its character despite the development that transformed neighboring areas. The harbor remains the heart of the community, its restaurants famous across the region for grilled fish and paella with a view. The Saturday market draws visitors from miles around, its stalls spilling through the streets with fresh produce, flowers, clothing, and treasures. And the beaches—rocky coves with water so clear you can see the bottom from ten meters—offer something different from the wide sandy stretches elsewhere.",
    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Life in Cabo Roig moves at Mediterranean pace. The harbor is where mornings begin—coffee at a terrace watching fishermen sort their catch. The coves invite swimming in water that feels like a natural swimming pool, rock formations creating private spaces even in summer. The Saturday market is a social event as much as shopping—running into neighbors, discovering the week's freshest produce, perhaps a glass of something cold afterward.\n\nThe community here tends toward those seeking authenticity over convenience. Yes, La Zenia Boulevard is just 2 km away when you need modern shopping. But the appeal of Cabo Roig is its difference—the feeling that you've found something special that mass tourism hasn't touched.",

      "beaches": "Cabo Roig's beaches are different—and that's the point. Cala Capitán is the jewel: a rocky cove with crystal-clear turquoise water, natural rock pools perfect for children, and excellent snorkeling. Cala Caleta offers similar beauty with fewer crowds. For traditional sandy beach, La Zenia is just 1 km north. The coastline here rewards exploration—hidden spots, dramatic rocks, that perfect swimming hole.",
      "dining": "The harbor restaurants are legendary. Fresh fish grilled simply, arroz caldero (the local rice dish), prawns that were swimming this morning—this is Spanish coastal cooking at its finest. Prices are reasonable, views are included. The commercial strip along the main road offers everything from British pubs to Italian trattorias. For variety, La Zenia Boulevard's 30+ restaurants are 5 minutes away.",
      "shopping": "Cabo Roig has traditional shops, supermarkets, and pharmacies for daily needs. But the real shopping experience is the Saturday market—hundreds of stalls, fresh produce, fish, flowers, clothing, housewares, and the indefinable treasures that make markets special. For major shopping, La Zenia Boulevard (2 km) has 150+ stores including all major brands.",
      "healthcare": "Hospital Universitario de Torrevieja is 10 km away (12 minutes), with comprehensive services and English-speaking staff. Several private clinics, dentists, and 24-hour pharmacies serve the area. Many healthcare providers are accustomed to international patients given the expat population.",
      "transport": "Alicante-Elche Airport is 52 km away (38 minutes via AP-7). Murcia-Corvera Airport is 35 km (28 minutes). A car is recommended for maximum convenience, though the area is walkable for daily needs. Coastal buses connect to Torrevieja and other towns. Taxis are readily available."

Harbor-view and cove-proximity properties are particularly sought after.\n\nThe rental market is strong with a slightly different profile than La Zenia. Cabo Roig attracts couples, golf groups, and those seeking authentic Mediterranean experience over shopping convenience. Rentals tend toward longer stays with higher per-night rates. Premium properties near the harbor achieve excellent yields.\n\nResale properties often offer larger plots and established gardens. Some of the most desirable properties in Orihuela Costa are older villas in Cabo Roig with character that new builds can't replicate.",

        "question": "Is Cabo Roig suitable for families?",
