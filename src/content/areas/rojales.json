    "quickAnswer": "Rojales is a historic Spanish town on the River Segura offering authentic character and excellent value from €145,000. Famous for its Sunday market (one of the region's largest), cave houses, and riverside setting. Beaches are 8-12 minutes away, with Torrevieja hospital 12 minutes. Includes Ciudad Quesada.",
    "heroIntro": "The River Segura has shaped Rojales for centuries, carving its path through the landscape and creating the fertile vega that sustains the town. On Sunday mornings, the riverside comes alive with one of Costa Blanca's largest markets, stalls stretching along the water as they have for generations. This is a town with roots that go deeper than the tourist developments surrounding it.\n\nRojales is the municipal seat that includes Ciudad Quesada within its boundaries, but the town center itself offers something different—genuine Spanish history, cave houses carved into hillsides, a river that flows year-round, and a community that maintains its traditions. The modern urbanizations nearby provide comfortable living; the town center provides soul.\n\nFor buyers seeking Spanish authenticity with modern convenience accessible, Rojales bridges both worlds.",
    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Life in Rojales town center follows Spanish rhythms—morning coffee at riverside cafés, the bustle of Sunday market, evening paseo along the river banks. The cave houses (casas cueva) carved into the hillsides are now museums and curiosities, reminding visitors this town existed long before tourism. Yet Ciudad Quesada and other urbanizations just minutes away offer modern living with international communities.\n\nThis duality is the opportunity: choose authentic town center living for genuine immersion, or modern urbanization for comfort with authenticity close by. Either way, you're connected to something real.",
