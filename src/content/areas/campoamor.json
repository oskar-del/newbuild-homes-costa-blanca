    "quickAnswer": "Campoamor is the quieter, more upscale end of Orihuela Costa with its own Blue Flag beach and Campoamor Golf course. Properties start at €195,000 for apartments, €350,000 for townhouses, €500,000 for villas. Less commercial than La Zenia, more refined than Cabo Roig.",
    "heroIntro": "At the southern end of Orihuela Costa, where the coast curves toward Pilar de la Horadada, Campoamor maintains a quieter elegance that distinguishes it from its busier neighbors. The beach is Blue Flag quality but less crowded. The golf course is excellent but less hectic. The restaurants serve quality without pretension. This is Orihuela Costa for those who want the lifestyle without the crowds.\n\nCampoamor grew more deliberately than some neighboring areas, with lower-density development and more space between properties. The result is a more refined atmosphere—still accessible, still friendly, but with room to breathe. The beach and golf course anchor daily life, with La Zenia Boulevard's shopping close enough for convenience but far enough to preserve tranquility.\n\nFor buyers seeking quality coastal living without compromise, Campoamor delivers understated excellence.",
    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Life in Campoamor balances beach and golf without the commercial bustle of La Zenia or the tourist density of Cabo Roig. Morning coffee might be at the golf club or a beachfront café. Afternoons offer beach time on sand that's genuinely less crowded. Evenings bring good dining without queuing for tables.\n\nThe international community is established but smaller than in neighboring areas—more opportunity for genuine connection, less anonymity. Those seeking non-stop activity should look elsewhere; those seeking quality of life find it here.",
