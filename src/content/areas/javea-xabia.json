    "heroIntro": "Jávea (Xàbia in Valencian) is widely considered the jewel of Costa Blanca North. This picturesque coastal town combines authentic Spanish character with a thriving international community, world-class beaches, and a microclimate that's been officially recognized as one of the healthiest in the world by the World Health Organization.\n\nUnlike the high-rise developments of the southern Costa Blanca, Jávea has maintained strict building regulations that preserve its traditional character. The town is divided into three distinct areas: the historic old town with its Gothic church and traditional architecture, the bustling port area with excellent seafood restaurants, and the Arenal beach zone with its famous sandy beach and promenade.",
    "lifestyleSection": {
      "intro": "Life in Jávea moves at a relaxed Mediterranean pace, yet offers everything you need for comfortable modern living. The town attracts a discerning international community—predominantly British, German, and Dutch—who appreciate quality of life over tourist-focused development.\n\nThe culinary scene is exceptional, from traditional tapas bars in the old town to Michelin-quality restaurants along the port. Weekly markets, year-round festivals, and an active social calendar mean there's always something happening.",
      "highlights": [
        "WHO-recognized microclimate with 300+ sunny days annually",
        "Three distinct zones: Old Town, Port, and Arenal Beach",
        "Strong international community with English widely spoken",

    "amenitiesSection": {
      "beaches": "Jávea boasts over 20 km of coastline with diverse beach options. The Arenal is the main sandy beach with a palm-lined promenade, perfect for families. La Granadella has been voted Spain's best beach multiple times—a stunning cove with crystal-clear waters. For something quieter, hidden coves like Portitxol and Ambolo offer secluded swimming spots.",
      "dining": "The port area is the culinary heart of Jávea, with restaurants serving fresh-caught seafood daily. Try arroz a banda (local fish rice) or gambas rojas (red prawns) at waterfront terraces. The old town offers traditional Spanish tapas, while Arenal has international cuisine. Several restaurants hold Michelin recommendations.",
      "shopping": "The old town features boutique shops, artisan stores, and the covered market hall for fresh produce. Arenal has beachwear shops and cafés. For larger shopping, Dénia (15 min) and Ondara (20 min) have major supermarkets and retail parks including a large Carrefour and MediaMarkt.",
      "healthcare": "Hospital de Dénia (Marina Salud) is a modern private-public hospital just 15 km away, offering comprehensive medical services with English-speaking staff. Jávea has numerous private clinics, dentists, and pharmacies. Many residents also use private health insurance for faster access to specialists.",
      "transport": "Alicante-Elche Airport is 90 km (approximately 1 hour) via the AP-7 motorway. Valencia Airport is 110 km (1 hour 15 minutes). The town is well-connected by road, though having a car is essential. Local buses connect to Dénia, which has a tram line to Alicante."
    },
    "propertyMarketSection": "The Jávea property market focuses on quality over quantity. New build developments are limited due to strict planning regulations, making each project highly sought after. Most new builds are luxury villas in elevated positions with sea views.\n\nPrices for new build villas typically start around €700,000 for 3-bedroom properties, rising to €2-3 million for premium sea-view villas. The market attracts buyers seeking permanent homes or high-end holiday properties rather than pure investment.\n\nThe limited supply of new builds, combined with consistent international demand, has resulted in steady price appreciation. Properties in the sought-after Balcón al Mar and La Corona areas command premium prices for their panoramic sea views.",
