    "metaDescription": "Complete guide to Costa Blanca South property. Orihuela Costa beaches, Torrevieja salt lakes, 20+ golf courses. Properties from €145k. Discover why buyers choose the sunny south.",
    "quickAnswer": "Costa Blanca South stretches from Guardamar del Segura to the Murcia border, offering Europe's healthiest climate (WHO-recognized), 20+ golf courses, Blue Flag beaches, and property prices 25-40% lower than Costa Blanca North. Main areas include Torrevieja, Orihuela Costa, and inland towns like Algorfa and Ciudad Quesada. Properties from €145,000.",
    "heroIntro": "Where the sun shines 320 days a year and the World Health Organization recognizes the climate as one of Europe's healthiest, Costa Blanca South has quietly become Spain's most popular destination for international property buyers. This isn't the Costa Blanca of high-rise tourism—this is something different.\n\nFrom the pink salt lakes of Torrevieja to the rocky coves of Cabo Roig, from the championship golf courses of Villamartin to the unspoiled dunes of Guardamar, Costa Blanca South offers remarkable variety within a compact area. Every beach town is within 20 minutes of every golf course. The hospital serves everyone. The airport connects to everywhere.\n\nBut perhaps what draws buyers most is the value. Properties here cost 25-40% less than equivalent homes on Costa Blanca North or the Costa del Sol, yet the lifestyle is equally rich—just with more sunshine and less pretension.",
    "regionOverview": {
      "geography": "Costa Blanca South occupies the southernmost portion of Alicante Province, stretching roughly 60 km from Guardamar del Segura in the north to Pilar de la Horadada at the Murcia border. The coastline alternates between sandy beaches and rocky coves, while inland rises gently toward agricultural hinterland dotted with golf courses and residential developments.",
      "climate": "The region enjoys a semi-arid Mediterranean climate with average temperatures of 10-16°C in winter and 26-32°C in summer. Rainfall averages just 300mm annually, with most precipitation falling October-December. The famous salt lakes create a microclimate with exceptionally clean, mineral-rich air—hence the WHO recognition.",
      "population": "Torrevieja alone has 80,000+ residents representing 100+ nationalities. The wider region houses significant British, German, Scandinavian, and Dutch communities alongside Spanish residents. During summer, the population swells with tourists and second-home owners.",
      "accessibility": "Alicante-Elche Airport (ALC) serves the region, with flights to 150+ European destinations. Drive times range from 20 minutes (San Fulgencio) to 50 minutes (Pilar de la Horadada). Murcia-Corvera Airport (RMU) offers an alternative for southern areas. The AP-7 motorway runs the length of the coast."
