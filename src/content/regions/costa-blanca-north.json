    "heroIntro": "Where the mountains meet the Mediterranean in dramatic fashion, Costa Blanca North has long been Spain's most prestigious coastal address. This isn't mass tourism territory—this is where discerning buyers seek authentic Mediterranean living among traditional villages, dramatic cliffs, and some of Europe's most beautiful coastline.\n\nFrom the old town charm of Altea to the sailing haven of Javea, from the boutique sophistication of Moraira to the iconic Peñón de Ifach in Calpe, Costa Blanca North offers a Mediterranean lifestyle that has attracted international residents for decades. The region combines Spanish authenticity with international convenience, natural beauty with cultural richness.\n\nPrices are higher here than in the south—but for many, the dramatic landscapes, established communities, and refined atmosphere justify the premium.",
    "regionOverview": {
      "geography": "Costa Blanca North occupies the northern portion of Alicante Province, roughly from Denia south to Benidorm. The coastline features dramatic cliffs, hidden coves, and the iconic headlands of Cabo de la Nao and the Peñón de Ifach. Inland, valleys give way to mountains, creating the dramatic backdrop that defines the region.",
      "climate": "Mediterranean climate with mild winters (12-18°C) and warm summers (25-32°C). Protected by mountains from extreme weather, the region enjoys a microclimate with less humidity than further south. Rainfall is higher than Costa Blanca South but still modest (400-500mm annually).",
      "population": "The region has significant British, German, Dutch, and Scandinavian communities alongside Spanish residents. Towns like Javea have 40%+ international residents. The communities are well-established, often multigenerational, with strong integration into Spanish life.",
      "accessibility": "Alicante-Elche Airport (ALC) serves the region, with drive times of 50-90 minutes depending on location. Valencia Airport offers an alternative for northern towns like Denia (60 min). The AP-7 motorway and scenic N-332 provide road access."

      },
      {
        "question": "How does Javea compare to Moraira?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I live without a car in Costa Blanca North?",

        "question": "What about schools in Costa Blanca North?",
        "answer": "Several international schools including Lady Elizabeth School (Javea), Laude Newton College (Elche area accessible), and The British School of Alicante. Spanish schools throughout. Generally good options for families, especially in Javea area."
      }
    ],
    "conclusion": "Costa Blanca North offers something different from the mass-market coast: dramatic scenery, authentic communities, refined lifestyle, and properties that feel like genuine Mediterranean homes rather than holiday investments. The premium prices reflect genuine quality—of location, community, and lifestyle. For buyers seeking the best of Spanish coastal living and willing to invest accordingly, Costa Blanca North rewards handsomely."
