    "title": "About TALMAR",
    "content": "TALMAR has built a portfolio focused on delivering contemporary residential solutions in dynamic Costa Blanca locations. The developer's approach emphasizes clean lines, efficient layouts, and practical design—avoiding unnecessary embellishment in favor of livable, well-proportioned spaces.\n\nThe two flagship developments showcase this philosophy distinctly. Edificio Sonata and Edificio Soprano represent different takes on modern residential design, each tailored to its specific location and target resident. This differentiated approach suggests a developer responsive to local context and market demand rather than one applying a single template across all projects."
