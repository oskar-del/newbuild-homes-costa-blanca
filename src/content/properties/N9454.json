    "content": "Torrevieja stands out among Costa Blanca destinations for its authentic Spanish character combined with international appeal. Unlike purely tourist-focused resorts, this working town of 80,000 residents provides year-round services, healthcare, and cultural activities. The famous pink and green salt lakes create a unique landscape and contribute to the area's beneficial microclimate. Torrevieja's extensive coastline features a variety of beaches from bustling Playa del Cura to the quieter Playa de la Mata. The town center buzzes with traditional Spanish life - morning markets, afternoon siestas, and evening paseos along the waterfront. International residents from across Europe have created a welcoming expat community while preserving the town's Spanish essence. Excellent transport links via the AP-7 autopista connect you to Alicante Airport in 45 minutes and Valencia in 90 minutes. The presence of a modern hospital, international schools, and major supermarket chains makes Torrevieja equally suitable for permanent residence or extended holidays.",

  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's rental market remains robust throughout the year, supported by both summer holidaymakers and winter residents from Northern Europe. Three-bedroom properties with pools command premium rental rates, typically achieving €500-700 per week during peak summer months and €300-450 during shoulder seasons. Annual rental yields of 5-7% are achievable with active management, while long-term rentals to year-round expat residents provide steady income of €600-800 monthly. Torrevieja's established infrastructure and continued development projects, including marina expansions and beach improvements, support property values. The €245,000 price point represents excellent value compared to similar coastal locations in France or Italy, while Spain's Golden Visa program attracts international investment. Recent market data shows Torrevieja properties have recovered strongly from previous downturns, with steady 3-5% annual appreciation expected as Costa Blanca remains Europe's preferred sunshine destination.",
