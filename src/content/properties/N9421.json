    "title": "Living in Torrevieja: Your Costa Blanca Lifestyle",
    "content": "Torrevieja ranks among Costa Blanca's most established international communities, where English and Scandinavian languages blend seamlessly with Spanish culture. The town's two distinct areas cater to different preferences - the traditional Spanish center around the harbor and church, and the modern residential zones extending inland. Year-round sunshine averaging 320 days annually makes outdoor living viable in every season. The famous salt lakes provide therapeutic benefits and attract flamingo populations, while the Mediterranean shoreline offers both active beaches like Playa del Cura and quieter spots like Playa de los Náufragos. Healthcare facilities include the modern University Hospital of Torrevieja, while international schools serve expatriate families. The town's compact size means most amenities remain within walking or short driving distance, yet Alicante city's cultural attractions and business facilities are just 45 minutes away.",
