  "investmentSection": "Torrevieja's rental market remains one of Costa Blanca's strongest, driven by consistent year-round tourism and a substantial expat rental population. Properties with private pools typically achieve 15-25% higher rental rates than comparable properties without, with weekly rates ranging from €600-900 depending on season. The city's position as a major holiday destination ensures occupancy rates of 70-85% for well-managed properties, translating to gross rental yields of 6-8% annually. Brexit has increased UK buyer interest in Spanish property ownership rather than rental, slightly reducing long-term rental supply while maintaining strong demand. Torrevieja's infrastructure investments, including port improvements and transport links, continue supporting property values. The local government's focus on maintaining blue flag beaches and cultural attractions ensures tourism sustainability. Capital appreciation has averaged 3-5% annually over recent years, with properties featuring private pools showing stronger growth. The €370,000 price point targets both holiday home buyers and rental investors, providing good liquidity for future resale.",
