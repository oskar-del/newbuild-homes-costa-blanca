    "quickAnswer": "Orihuela Costa is a purpose-built resort destination with multiple urbanizations, excellent golf access (4 world-class courses), modern apartments from €155,000, and resort-like amenities. Torrevieja is an authentic Spanish city with better services, lower prices (from €129,000), distinctive salt lakes, and strong Northern European community. Choose Orihuela Costa for golf and resort living; choose Torrevieja for authentic Spain and better value.",
    "intro": "Separated by just 15 kilometers and distinctly different in character, Orihuela Costa and Torrevieja represent two approaches to coastal living on Costa Blanca South. Though they're virtually neighbors, their identities couldn't be more different.\n\nOrihuela Costa is purpose-built for tourism and leisure—a collection of integrated urbanizations (residential communities) designed around golf, beaches, and international amenities. Torrevieja, by contrast, is a real Spanish city with authentic character, stronger local infrastructure, and genuine roots in the region's maritime and salt-harvesting heritage.\n\nBoth offer excellent Mediterranean living, but to very different buyer profiles. Understanding these differences is essential for making the right choice.",

        "title": "Development Philosophy & Urban Design",
        "content": "**Orihuela Costa** is defined by planned urbanizations—organized residential communities with shared infrastructure, gated security, and coordinated amenities. Major urbanizations include Las Ramblas, Villamartín, Campoamor, Sotogrande, and Polaris. Each urbanization typically has community facilities, restaurants, shops, and pools. The infrastructure is modern and coordinated, with clear sight lines and planned layouts. This is not a traditional city—it's a resort-style residential development.\n\n**Torrevieja** is a traditional Spanish city with organic growth patterns. The historic center retains Spanish character with narrow streets, plazas, and markets. The city infrastructure—hospitals, municipal services, government offices—operates at city level. Traditional shops and Spanish restaurants dominate, though international businesses increasingly serve expat communities. This is a functioning Spanish city that has attracted international residents, rather than purpose-built for them.\n\n**Verdict:** Orihuela Costa for organized resort living; Torrevieja for authentic Spanish city infrastructure."

      {
        "title": "Golf & Sports Infrastructure",
        "content": "**Orihuela Costa** is the undisputed golf capital of Costa Blanca. Four world-class golf courses are within 5-15 minutes:\n- Villamartín Golf Course (18 holes, championship quality, founded 1974)\n- Las Ramblas Golf Course (18 holes with driving range, upscale clubhouse)\n- Campoamor Golf Club (18 holes, scenic clifftop location)\n- Las Colinas Golf & Country Club (18 holes, exclusive community)\n\nEach urbanization is positioned for golf access. Many properties include community golf membership or preferred rates. Golf-centric lifestyle is embedded in the infrastructure.\n\n**Torrevieja** has no golf courses within the city. Nearest course is Villamartín at 25 kilometers (30 minutes drive). Torrevieja prioritizes beach sports, with water sports clubs, sailing facilities, and beach activities. Sports infrastructure focuses on sea-based activities rather than golf.\n\n**Verdict:** Orihuela Costa dramatically superior for golf; Torrevieja for water sports and beach activities."

        "title": "Property Prices & Property Types",
        "content": "Both areas offer diverse property types, but with different price positioning and character. Orihuela Costa properties tend toward modern developments in planned communities. Torrevieja offers more varied properties from older Spanish apartments to new builds.\n\n**Orihuela Costa typical prices (2026):**\n- New build apartments: €155,000 - €320,000\n- Townhouses: €220,000 - €420,000\n- Villas: €350,000 - €680,000\n- Golf-adjacent properties: add 10-20% premium\n\n**Torrevieja typical prices (2026):**\n- New build apartments: €129,000 - €280,000\n- Townhouses: €180,000 - €350,000\n- Villas: €300,000 - €500,000\n- Older resale properties: €95,000 - €220,000\n\n**Verdict:** Torrevieja offers better value; Orihuela Costa premium reflects golf and resort infrastructure."

        "title": "Beaches & Water Access",
        "content": "**Orihuela Costa** has several beaches: Playa Flamenca (wide sandy beach with good facilities), Playa Paraiso (family-friendly), and others. Beaches are generally good quality with lifeguards and bars. However, beach access varies by urbanization—some residents are 15+ minutes walk from sand. The area has achieved Blue Flag status at certain beaches. Water sports facilities are available.\n\n**Torrevieja** offers 8 kilometers of coastline with multiple beaches: Playa del Cura, Playa del Acequión, and Playa Punta Prima. Most properties are closer to beaches than Orihuela Costa. The city's unique feature is the salt lakes—Laguna de la Mata and Salinas de Torrevieja—which create distinctive pink and green colors and attract flamingos. The beaches are less commercialized and family-friendly.\n\n**Verdict:** Torrevieja for proximity to beaches and unique salt lake scenery; Orihuela Costa for formal resort beaches."

        "title": "Community & Social Atmosphere",
        "content": "**Orihuela Costa** has a cosmopolitan, international expat community—predominantly British, German, and Scandinavian residents. The community is dispersed across urbanizations, each with its own social structure. Many residents are retirees or semi-retirees seeking leisure lifestyle. The atmosphere is golf-and-resort focused. Social life often revolves around community facilities, clubs, and organized activities. English is widely spoken.\n\n**Torrevieja** has an established, long-term Northern European community (especially Scandinavian) integrated with Spanish residents. The community is stronger in organized groups (clubs, associations) with dedicated infrastructure. There's more authentic cultural mixing than in Orihuela Costa. Spanish language is more prevalent, though many services support English speakers. The community has deeper roots (many residents of 15+ years).\n\n**Verdict:** Orihuela Costa for cosmopolitan resort community; Torrevieja for integrated multicultural Spanish city living."

        "title": "Shopping & Amenities",
        "content": "**Orihuela Costa** shopping is distributed across urbanizations. Each has local shops, restaurants, and services. However, for major shopping, residents typically drive to Benidorm (40 km, 45 minutes) or Alicante. The area lacks a major shopping center. Restaurants are scattered across urbanizations, ranging from international to Spanish. Services cater to tourism.\n\n**Torrevieja** offers centralized city shopping with traditional Spanish shops, markets, and services concentrated in the historic center. The famous Saturday market (Mercado) is a major attraction with fresh produce and local goods. Shopping infrastructure is urban and complete—groceries, pharmacies, banks, post office, hospitals all within city. Restaurants range from traditional Spanish tabernas to international venues. Municipal services are robust.\n\n**Verdict:** Torrevieja for traditional shopping and city services; Orihuela Costa for resort-style amenities."

        "content": "**Orihuela Costa** performs well for holiday rentals, especially golf-focused properties. Summer occupancy is high (60-75%), but winter drops significantly (20-35%). Long-term rentals are less common. Properties near golf courses or with resort amenities rent at premium rates. The tourist/leisure market is the primary driver.\n\n**Torrevieja** has moderate seasonal tourism but stronger long-term rental market. Summer occupancy is 30-50%, winter slightly higher due to established expat communities. Long-term rentals to expats or Spanish tenants are more stable and profitable annually. The market is balanced between tourism and residential.\n\n**Verdict:** Orihuela Costa for high-season golf tourism rentals; Torrevieja for year-round residential rental stability."

Municipal services are adequate but basic—the area relies on urbanization-level infrastructure. Medical care requires traveling to Torrevieja or Alicante.\n\n**Torrevieja** has lower cost of living reflecting its authentic Spanish city character. Groceries, traditional restaurants, and services are cheaper. The Saturday market offers excellent value produce. Municipal services are robust and accessible locally—hospitals, clinics, government offices, and civic infrastructure are city-level.

The area is car-dependent. Walking between neighborhoods is impractical (distances 2-5 km).\n\n**Torrevieja** is walkable in the city center. Most services are within walking distance for central residents. Beaches are accessible on foot from many properties. Public transport (buses) is adequate. The city is compact enough for walkability though some outlying neighborhoods require cars.\n\n**Verdict:** Torrevieja for walkability; Orihuela Costa for car-dependent mobility."
