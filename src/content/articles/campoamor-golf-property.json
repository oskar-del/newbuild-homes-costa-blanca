This royal designation reflects decades of established excellence and community prominence.\n\nThe club maintains formal, traditional club structure.

This exclusive positioning appeals to those valuing prestige and established golf culture.\n\nThe course's history spans decades—providing mature landscape, established reputation, and proven operational excellence. Multi-generational families often maintain club memberships, creating social stability.\n\nCampoamor's royal status influences property valuations.

The championship length presents appropriate challenge to skilled players while remaining playable through multiple tee configurations.\n\nThe course routing incorporates natural landscape features—elevation changes, Mediterranean vegetation, strategic water positioning. Rather than artificial difficulty, the design emphasizes position-reward strategy.\n\nWater features integrate meaningfully. Several dramatic holes feature carries over water creating memorable visual impressions. Most importantly, water placement rewards strategic positioning—conservative lines avoid water; aggressive lines risk water but create scoring opportunities.\n\nBunkerwork emphasizes course architecture. Bunkers frame fairway corners, protect greens, and define playing corridors. Their strategic positioning requires thoughtful club selection and shot placement.\n\nThe course character emphasizes tradition rather than modern resort gloss. Mature trees, established landscaping, and classic conditioning create timeless appeal. For traditionalists, this character surpasses newer resort courses."

While higher than budget courses, fees remain reasonable for championship quality.\n\nProperty owners within Dehesa de Campoamor typically receive membership benefits or discounts—sometimes complimentary membership with property purchase, sometimes significant discounts. This integration encourages resident engagement.\n\nThe membership structure emphasizes club community. Social events, competitions, and member gatherings create engagement beyond pure golf play. This community aspect distinguishes prestige clubs from commercial facilities."

Unlike dense urban developments, Dehesa maintains spacious character.\n\nArchitectural guidelines ensure aesthetic coherence. Mediterranean-style properties dominate—terracotta roofing, warm-colored walls, arched entryways. This consistency creates harmonious community character.\n\nThe residential positioning—adjacent to championship golf, near Mediterranean beaches—attracts affluent, cosmopolitan residents. Properties serve upscale vacation homes, permanent residences, and investment vehicles for discerning buyers.\n\nThe exclusive character appeals to those valuing prestige and established community.

Rather than single-course commitment, members enjoy two championship courses within short driving distance. Different routing, varied challenge, and scheduling flexibility enhance the golf experience.\n\nFor property buyers, this dual-course access adds significant value. Two courses enable extended play patterns without monotony. The combination of Campoamor prestige plus Las Ramblas access creates compelling golf value."

Architectural distinction increases—custom detailing, elevated positioning, or distinctive landscaping differentiate from entry properties.\n\nPremium villas (€550,000-600,000+) represent community signature properties. These showcase exceptional locations—often with frontline golf positioning providing morning fairway views, elevated Mediterranean vistas, or premium community positioning. Built areas exceed 300 sqm with sophisticated finishes.\n\nFrontline golf villas command substantial premiums—20-35% uplift from comparable rear-facing properties. The psychological and practical appeal of golf course adjacency justifies premium pricing.\n\nVilla specifications typically include private pools (virtually standard), underbuilds or extensive garages, generous terracing for entertaining, modern kitchens with quality appliances, and spa bathrooms.
