    "quickAnswer": "British pensioners use S1 forms (applied before moving) for free Spanish healthcare. Visitors under 90 days use GHIC cards (emergency only). Pre-retirement residents face a gap period requiring private insurance (€50-200/month). Private insurance supplements Spanish public healthcare. Understanding your coverage status before moving prevents healthcare disruptions.",
    "intro": "Healthcare is perhaps the most anxiety-provoking aspect of moving to Spain for British nationals. The system is completely different from the NHS, rules changed post-Brexit, and timing is critical—miss one step and you're paying privately.\n\nThe good news: Spain has excellent healthcare at a fraction of UK costs. The challenge: Understanding which option applies to you and applying well in advance. This guide demystifies healthcare coverage for British nationals in Spain, from S1 forms through private insurance, ensuring you're never without coverage.",

    "conclusion": "Healthcare in Spain is accessible, affordable, and high-quality. The key is understanding which system applies to you and securing coverage before you move. Pensioners must obtain S1 forms pre-arrival, pre-retirement residents need private insurance for the gap period, and all visitors should understand GHIC's limitations.\n\nProper planning ensures you never face a healthcare gap and can enjoy Spain's excellent medical system. We help British buyers understand their healthcare options and connect them with Spanish healthcare specialists. Contact us to discuss healthcare coverage for your Spanish property ownership.",

      {
        "question": "What's the most important document for healthcare in Spain as a British pensioner?",
        "answer": "The S1 form. It grants you free access to Spanish public healthcare. You MUST obtain it before moving to Spain (takes 4-6 weeks). Without it, you'll pay privately. Apply through UK Overseas Healthcare Services at least 3 months before your move."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use my GHIC card instead of getting S1?",
        "answer": "No. GHIC is emergency-only for visitors and cannot be used to register with Spanish healthcare. S1 is required for permanent healthcare access. If you're a pensioner, you need S1. If you're visiting temporarily, GHIC covers emergencies only (not comprehensive healthcare)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I retire before reaching state pension age and move to Spain?",
        "answer": "You have a gap period where you're not yet eligible for S1. You must have private insurance during this time (€60-200/month). Plan for this cost in your retirement budget. At state pension age, you switch to S1 (free public healthcare)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does private health insurance cost in Spain?",
        "answer": "Typically €60-200/month depending on age and coverage. Ages 45-50: €80-150/month. Ages 50-60: €120-250/month. Ages 65+: €300-600+/month. Pre-existing conditions increase costs significantly. Dental coverage adds €20-50/month."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Spanish healthcare free for British residents?",
        "answer": "Yes, if you have S1 form (pensioners) or are registered through a work visa. Healthcare is free through the public system: GP visits, hospital, specialists, emergency care all free. Prescriptions usually €10 copay. Private healthcare has full costs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I need dental work in Spain?",
        "answer": "Dental is not covered by public healthcare (only emergency extraction). Private dental is very affordable: cleaning €40-80, filling €80-150, crown €300-600, implants €1,500-2,500 (much cheaper than UK). Consider private dental insurance (€15-40/month) if you want regular care."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I continue taking my UK medications in Spain?",
        "answer": "Yes. See a Spanish doctor with your UK prescription. Spanish doctors will usually issue equivalent prescriptions. Most UK medications are available in Spain at much lower costs (50-80% cheaper). Prescriptions cost €10 copay at pharmacies."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the emergency number in Spain?",
        "answer": "112 (works from any phone). Operators speak English. Ambulance is free for public patients. Hospitals must treat life-threatening emergencies regardless of payment ability. Call for any life-threatening emergency without hesitation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I register with Spanish healthcare once I arrive?",
        "answer": "Take your passport, S1 form (if pensioner), padrón certificate, and NIF to your local Centro de Salud (health center). Complete registration forms. You'll be assigned a GP. Can use healthcare immediately. Full registration takes 1-2 weeks."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I combine S1 public healthcare with private insurance?",
        "answer": "Yes, many people do. Use S1 for routine GP care (free) and private for rapid specialist access or services not in public system (dental, private rooms, therapies). This provides good coverage balance. Private insurance is supplementary."
