        "title": "Geography & History",
        "content": "Denia occupies a significant geographic position at Costa Blanca's northern extent, strategically positioned between Javea (25 kilometers south, 30 minutes) and Valencia (130 kilometers north, 2 hours). The port town's geographic positioning created historical importance as a Mediterranean trading center—Greek, Roman, Moorish, and medieval Christian periods all left distinctive marks on the town's development.\n\nThe Denia Castle (Castillo de Denia), originally constructed in the 11th-century as a Moorish fortress, dominated the harbor and surrounding landscape for centuries. Subsequent Christian reconquest saw reconstruction and adaptation to new military requirements. Today's restored castle offers historical exhibition, defensive structure views, and panoramic vistas across harbor and Mediterranean. The castle's prominence influences cultural identity—Denia residents maintain strong connection to the site despite modern development.\n\nHistory permeates Denia's character. Medieval streets in the historic quarter preserve original urban patterns. Archaeological evidence indicates continuous habitation from antiquity through modern times. This historical depth distinguishes Denia from newer resort destinations—the town maintains evolved character shaped by centuries of Mediterranean commerce and habitation.\n\nModern Denia combines historical significance with vibrant contemporary Mediterranean port. Working fishing boats still operate from the harbor. Agricultural traditions—particularly the famous Denia red beans—maintain cultural relevance. The UNESCO designation recognizes this authentic blend of historical tradition, contemporary culinary excellence, and living food culture unavailable in purely modern resort settings."

Entry-level investment properties generating modest rental income (€400-€800 monthly off-season, €1,200-€1,800 seasonal). Older buildings occasionally require renovation. Property management and holiday rental potential provide income opportunities for investor-owners.\n\n**Standard Residences (€300,000-€500,000)**: Two-to-three bedroom townhouses, apartments, and modest villas throughout established neighborhoods.
