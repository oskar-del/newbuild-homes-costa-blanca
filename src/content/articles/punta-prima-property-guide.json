Properties constructed within the past decade showcase modern amenities including underfloor heating, air conditioning, premium kitchen appliances, smart home technology, and energy-efficient systems.

        "content": "Alicante-Elche Airport (ALC), located 45 kilometers north, serves as the primary international gateway for Punta Prima visitors and relocating residents. Direct flights operate from major European cities including London (UK), Stockholm, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and numerous others, with typical journey times of 2-3 hours. Car rental at the airport provides flexibility for exploring the region, with international rental agencies offering competitive rates from €25-€45 daily for basic vehicles.

        "title": "Expat Community & Local Lifestyle",
        "content": "Punta Prima hosts a sophisticated international community representing 65-70% of permanent residents. British nationals comprise the largest expat group (approximately 35%), followed by Scandinavians (20%), Dutch (12%), Germans (10%), and smaller communities from France, Belgium, and Central Europe. This demographic diversity creates cosmopolitan dining, shopping, and social environments while maintaining authentic Spanish character in older town sections. English-speaking services proliferate throughout Punta Prima including international real estate agents, English-speaking healthcare providers, expatriate-focused restaurants, and expatriate social clubs.

        "title": "Investment Potential & Returns",
        "content": "Punta Prima represents compelling investment opportunity within Costa Blanca South's tourism-dependent market. Vacation rental yields average 5-7% annually on property investment, with well-managed properties in prime locations generating €8,000-€12,000 yearly income from investment of €150,000-€200,000. Long-term residential rentals yield 3-4% annually, providing more stable income with lower management overhead. Property appreciation has averaged 3.5% annually over five-year periods, with forecasts suggesting 2-3% ongoing appreciation as supply constraints limit new development in premium beach locations. Currency diversification benefits UK investors, as euro appreciation against sterling increases property values and rental income when converted. Spanish tax implications merit professional advice—non-resident property owners pay 19% corporate income tax on rental profits, though expense deductions reduce taxable income. Resident property owners benefit from lower tax brackets and personal allowances. Capital gains taxation applies when selling, with rates varying based on ownership duration and residency status. Annual property taxes (IBI) typically range €1,200-€2,200 depending on property value and location. Professional property management companies handle bookings, maintenance, and rental collections for 20-30% of gross rental income, making hands-off investment feasible. Legal protections including 10-year construction warranties and property liability insurance provide security foundation. The combination of excellent tourist destination positioning, established international buyer base, and reliable rental demand makes Punta Prima particularly attractive for portfolio diversification and income generation."
