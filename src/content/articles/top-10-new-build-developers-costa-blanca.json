Visit completed projects and speak with existing residents about their experience. Verify that the developer has appropriate licenses, insurance, and guarantees in place.</p>\n\n<p>Consider whether the developer offers after-sales support, warranty periods, and maintenance services. Large, established developers typically offer better infrastructure and support, while boutique developers may provide more personalized service.</p>\n\n<h3>Quality and Standards</h3>\n\n<p>Reputable developers follow Spanish building codes and may exceed minimum requirements. Ask about construction materials, finishing standards, and energy efficiency certifications. Request detailed specifications and building plans before committing.</p>\n\n<h3>Location Strategy</h3>\n\n<p>Different developers excel in different areas. TM Grupo and Aedas Homes dominate the south, while Miralbo Urbana and Allonbay focus on northern coastal areas. Consider whether you want established developments with strong rental infrastructure or newer projects with growth potential.</p>\n\n<h2>Investment Potential</h2>\n\n<p>New build properties offer advantages including modern standards, warranties, and potential for value appreciation. Developers like Vistamarina Golf and Allonbay focus on premium segments with strong appreciation potential, while Aedas Homes and Grupo Presto offer solid middle-market investments with consistent returns.</p>\n\n<p>Properties in established developer communities often attract strong rental markets, particularly those near golf courses, beaches, or in popular retirement destinations like Orihuela Costa and Torrevieja.</p>\n\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n\n<p>Work with a local real estate agent familiar with these developers. They can provide insights into project timelines, available inventory, and market positioning. Request references from previous buyers and visit show properties and completed projects before making a decision. Ensure you obtain independent legal advice from a Spanish solicitor experienced in new build purchases.</p>",
