        "title": "Luxury Hotels",
        "content": "Parador de Jávea represents Spain's historic paradores program—this 54-room clifftop property commands dramatic Mediterranean views across the Arenal beach and beyond, featuring a Michelin-level restaurant showcasing Costa Blanca's finest ingredients. Rooms range €180-350 depending on season and view; the Deluxe suites justify premium pricing with private terraces and marble bathrooms. Peak season (July-August) requires advance booking; shoulder seasons (May-June, September-October) offer better value and fewer crowds. SHA Wellness Clinic in Altea sets global standards for holistic wellness—this ultra-luxury 127-room property integrates medical expertise, nutrition science, and spa treatments within Mediterranean architecture overlooking Altea Bay. Costs reflect exclusivity: €450-800 per night including wellness consultations, but justify themselves through measurable health outcomes and personalized attention. Hotel Diamante Beach in Calpe delivers five-star comfort without the pretension—oceanfront location, exceptional spa facilities, and a Michelin-starred restaurant create memorable stays (€200-380 per night). All three properties offer concierge services, restaurant reservations assistance, and can arrange property viewings with local real estate agents for serious buyers exploring relocation options."

        "title": "Boutique Options",
        "content": "Denia's Champaign Art Hotel combines contemporary design with old-world charm across 12 individually decorated rooms (€85-150 per night). The rooftop bar overlooks the marina; staff provide insider tips on local restaurants and cultural events. Moraira's Casa Coral, a converted mansion with seven suites, exemplifies intimate luxury—each room tells a design story, and the owners personally welcome guests with Spanish wine and local information. Despite small size, Casa Coral punches above its weight with exceptional service and attention to detail (€110-200 per night, minimum 2-night stays). Benissa's Hotel Los Acebos blends traditional village character with modern comfort across 20 rooms (€70-130), offering an authentic Spanish village experience without isolation—the location within walking distance of restaurants and the old town proves invaluable. Javea's Grupo Ibiza Hotels operates several boutique properties; the Spa Javea Marina balances modern amenities with local character, featuring a compact but excellent spa and waterfront dining (€100-160 per night). Boutique hotels excel at personal recommendations, arranging local activities, and providing cultural insights larger hotels cannot match."

        "title": "Family-Friendly",
        "content": "Benidorm's Marina D'Or Hotel caters specifically to families with spacious suites accommodating 4-6 people, kids' clubs, multiple pools (including shallow family sections), and direct beach access (€80-140 per night depending on size and season). The on-site restaurants understand child preferences while offering quality Spanish cuisine for adults. Denia's Hotel Denia Marriott aligns international standards families expect with Spanish warmth—kitchenette-equipped suites allow flexibility for families with infants or toddlers; the beach location and multiple dining options suit various preferences (€110-180 per night). For apartment-style accommodations, Aparthotel Los Pinos (Javea) provides two-bedroom units with kitchens and living areas (€90-150 per night), ideal for extended stays or multi-family trips. Staff arrange childminding, restaurant recommendations, and activity bookings. Calpe's Maryvilla Hotel offers an excellent mid-range option mixing family amenities with adult appeal—pools with kids' zones, beachfront location, and a lively nightlife scene keeps teenagers entertained while parents relax (€70-110 per night). Most family-friendly hotels offer ground-floor or accessible rooms, kids-eat-free programs, and beach equipment rentals."

        "title": "Beachfront Properties",
        "content": "Javea's Parador de Jávea dominates the Arenal with unobstructed sea views and direct beach access via private stairway. The clifftop location creates a magical sense of elevation while maintaining convenient beach proximity. Similarly, Calpe's Hotel Diamante Beach positions guests directly on Levante Beach with Mediterranean vistas from most rooms; the ground-floor restaurant opens onto sand and serves excellent paella and seafood. Benidorm's Marina D'Or and numerous other beachfront properties offer value and accessibility—queuing pros and cons of extensive beachfront developments include more facilities but more crowds. Denia's waterfront properties cluster near the marina, offering charming boat-watching experiences rather than traditional beach proximity; guests walk 200m to access main beaches but enjoy quiet harbourfront dining. For those prioritizing beach access above all, Altea's SHA Wellness Clinic's oceanfront position delivers premium beachfront living with wellness amenities—sunrise swims before massage treatments exemplify the integration. Always request sea-view rooms when booking, as many beachfront hotels include parking-lot-facing rooms despite waterfront locations; front desk can upgrade to true beachfront rooms, especially for multi-night stays."

        "title": "Booking Tips",
        "content": "Booking 6-8 weeks in advance secures better rates and guarantees availability during peak season (July-August). Shoulder seasons (May-June, September-October) offer superior value—prices drop 20-30% while weather remains excellent. Most hotels offer free cancellation up to 14 days before arrival; confirm this during booking. Subscribe to hotel email lists and follow social media for flash sales and package deals. Group bookings (8+ rooms) negotiate discounts directly with property management—don't rely solely on OTA (online travel agency) pricing. Visiting Friday-Sunday doubles rates versus weekday pricing, even in shoulder season. Request ground-floor rooms if mobility is a concern; premium room categories don't always mean higher floors. Mention real estate interest to concierges—many properties maintain relationships with local agents and can facilitate property viewings. Translation apps ease communication with Spanish-speaking staff; most employees in tourist areas speak English, but patience with language barriers builds goodwill. Finally, verify that quoted prices include all taxes and mandatory resort fees—hidden charges at checkout create frustration and surprise expenses."
