    "quickAnswer": "Key ready properties are fully completed, inspected homes ready for immediate occupancy. Unlike off-plan properties (under construction) or resales (older homes), key ready offers the certainty of seeing exactly what you're buying, new build standards, and the ability to move in or rent out within 4-6 weeks. Costa Blanca has numerous key ready developments with prices ranging from €170,000 in Torrevieja to €400,000+ in premium areas like Javea.",
    "intro": "Searching for a move-in ready home in Costa Blanca without construction risks? Key ready properties offer a compelling middle ground—new build quality without the wait. These are completed properties that have passed all inspections and hold their certificate of habitation (cédula de habitabilidad), meaning they're legal and safe to occupy immediately.\n\nWhether you want a holiday home you can use right away, an investment property generating rental income from day one, or simply prefer to see and touch what you're buying, key ready properties deserve serious consideration. This guide explains what key ready means, how it compares to other purchase types, and how to evaluate and buy key ready properties in Costa Blanca.",

        "title": "What Does 'Key Ready' Actually Mean?",
        "content": "Key ready (or 'move-in ready') properties are fully completed homes that meet all building codes and regulations. Here's what the term guarantees:\n\n**Fully completed**: Every element of construction is finished. Walls are built, roofs are on, interiors are fitted. There's no ongoing work or construction site.\n\n**Inspected and certified**: The property has passed all required building inspections. The developer or local authorities have verified it complies with Spanish building codes.\n\n**Certificate of habitation (cédula de habitabilidad)**: This is the critical document. It's a legal certificate issued by regional authorities confirming the property is safe, legal, and fit to occupy. Without it, you cannot register utilities, get insurance, or legally live in the property.\n\n**All finishes included**: Flooring, bathroom fixtures, kitchen appliances, painting, electrical systems, plumbing—everything specified in the contract is installed and working.\n\n**Ready within 4-6 weeks**: Unlike off-plan (which requires 12-24 months more), key ready properties can complete from exchange of contracts to keys in your hand within 4-6 weeks. Some complete even faster.\n\n**What it doesn't mean**: Key ready isn't the same as 'perfect.' There may still be minor snagging items (a light that needs replacing, a tile with a hairline crack). That's why professional inspection remains important. But structurally and legally, it's complete and ready to occupy."

        "title": "Key Ready vs Off-Plan vs Resale: The Complete Comparison",
        "content": "Understanding how key ready differs from other purchase types helps you make the right choice:\n\n**KEY READY PROPERTIES**\nStatus: Fully completed, inspected, with certificate of habitation\nConstruction timeline: 0 weeks—move in immediately\nWhat you see: The actual finished property\nPrice point: 10-15% higher than off-plan launch price, but lower than resale comparables\nNew build standards: Yes—energy efficient, modern, under guarantee\nPayment timeline: Completion 4-6 weeks after contract\nCustomization: Not possible—property is finished\nInventory risk: None—you're buying a completed property\nTitle guarantee: Building guarantee typically 10 years (structures)\n\n**OFF-PLAN PROPERTIES**\nStatus: Under construction, completion date projected\nConstruction timeline: 12-24 months until completion\nWhat you see: Plans and specifications, not the actual property\nPrice point: Lowest available—5-20% savings vs key ready\nNew build standards: Yes—modern standards, long guarantees\nPayment timeline: Staged payments over construction period\nCustomization: Extensive—change finishes, layouts, upgrades\nInventory risk: Developer delivery delay, specification changes\nTitle guarantee: Same 10-year structural guarantee\n\n**RESALE PROPERTIES (Existing Homes)**\nStatus: Previously owned, sold by current owners\nConstruction timeline: 0 weeks—move in immediately\nWhat you see: The actual finished property\nPrice point: Variable—depends on condition, age, location\nNew build standards: No—older building methods, possible renovation needs\nPayment timeline: Completion 4-6 weeks after contract\nCustomization: Post-purchase only through renovation\nInventory risk: Hidden defects, expensive surprises, no guarantees\nTitle guarantee: No structural guarantees (older than 10 years)\n\n**In summary**: Off-plan offers best pricing but longest wait. Key ready offers certainty and immediacy with reasonable pricing. Resale offers immediacy but potential renovation surprises. For new build quality without the construction timeline, key ready is the sweet spot."

        "title": "Key Ready Advantages: Why Buyers Choose This Option",
        "content": "Key ready properties offer distinct advantages over other purchase types:\n\n**See before you buy**: You're not purchasing from plans and renderings. You walk through the actual finished property. You see the views, experience natural light, check sightlines from balconies, and verify everything matches your vision. No surprises at completion.\n\n**No construction delays**: Off-plan buyers often wait additional months beyond the contracted completion date. Delays are common—bad weather, supply issues, labor shortages, or developer problems. With key ready, there's no construction timeline to slip. You complete when you're ready.\n\n**Immediate rental income**: For investors, key ready properties generate income from day one. You complete the purchase, upload photos, list on rental platforms, and guests can arrive within days. Off-plan investors must wait 12-24 months before the property produces any income.\n\n**No surprises or defects**: Off-plan properties sometimes have unexpected issues at completion—materials not matching specifications, workmanship problems, or items missing from the final property. Key ready has already been lived in (or at least thoroughly inspected)—defects are visible and the developer has already addressed them or they're your responsibility after completion.\n\n**Simpler financing**: Mortgage lenders prefer key ready properties because they can inspect completed work. Some lenders hesitate with off-plan projects by unknown developers. Financing a key ready property is often simpler and faster.\n\n**Peace of mind**: You're getting new build quality (modern standards, proper materials, full systems) with the certainty of a completed property. No timeline risk, no developer bankruptcy concerns, no construction oversight needed.\n\n**Furnished options available**: Many key ready properties are sold furnished or semi-furnished, saving you the effort of purchasing furniture and décor.\n\n**Instant rental ready**: For investors, furnished key ready properties can be generating rental income within weeks of purchase—a major advantage for buy-to-let strategies."

        "title": "Key Ready Disadvantages: Understanding the Trade-offs",
        "content": "Key ready properties aren't without drawbacks:\n\n**Higher price than off-plan**: Because the property is complete and immediately available, developers price key ready higher than off-plan launch prices. You might pay 10-15% more for a key ready property than if you'd bought the same development off-plan at launch. That premium buys you certainty and immediacy, but it's a cost to consider.\n\n**Limited customization**: What you see is what you get. The finishes, layout, kitchen, bathrooms—all are fixed. If you prefer a different tile selection, upgraded kitchen, or wall removed, you'll be paying for renovations post-purchase, not purchasing customizations during development.\n\n**Smaller selection**: Developers typically have fewer key ready units than off-plan options. Once a block is complete, sales happen relatively quickly. Choice of location, orientation, and floor plan is more limited than buying early in an off-plan phase.\n\n**May have minor defects**: Key ready properties still undergo snagging inspections. You may find minor issues—small tile cracks, paint touch-ups needed, fixtures requiring adjustment. Most are trivial, but they add cost and time when discovered.\n\n**Less flexibility on payment**: Off-plan offers staged payment schedules aligned with construction. Key ready requires payment within 4-6 weeks. If you need flexible payment terms, off-plan provides more options.\n\n**Potential previous occupancy**: Some key ready properties have been occupied briefly for marketing or showroom purposes. While generally immaculate, they're technically 'used' rather than truly 'new.' Most carry the same new build guarantees regardless."

        "title": "What to Check When Buying Key Ready: The Essential Inspection",
        "content": "Before completing your key ready purchase, conduct a thorough inspection to verify everything is as promised:\n\n**The Snagging List**\nA professional snagger (specialized property inspector) will document any defects:\n- Minor paint imperfections or color inconsistencies\n- Small tile cracks or chips\n- Plumbing leaks or water pressure issues\n- Electrical switches or sockets not functioning\n- Door or window alignment problems\n- Missing fixtures or appliances listed in contract\n- Cosmetic issues (scratches on fixtures, dents)\n\nThe developer should remedy all items before you take possession. Retain a portion of final payment (held by your lawyer) until snagging is resolved. Professional snagging costs €200-400 but typically saves far more in identified issues.\n\n**Certificate of Habitation (Cédula de Habitabilidad)**\nThis is non-negotiable. The property must have this certificate from regional authorities (in Valencia region, issued by the Colegio de Aparejadores). It proves:\n- Building complies with building codes\n- Property is legally habitable\n- All building systems meet safety standards\n\nWithout this certificate, you cannot legally occupy the property, register utilities, obtain insurance, or sell it. Never complete without verified possession of the original certificate.\n\n**Building Guarantee (Garantía de Construcción)**\nSpanish law mandates:\n- 10 years for structural defects (foundations, load-bearing walls)\n- 3 years for habitability defects (waterproofing, plumbing, heating systems)\n- 1 year for finishing defects (paintwork, fixtures, flooring)\n\nVerify:\n- Guarantee certificate is issued by developer and insurer\n- Guarantee covers the property (registered in your name or transferable)\n- Guarantee remains valid (check expiration dates)\n- Guarantee is assignable if you later sell\n\n**Utility Verification**\nCheck all systems are functioning:\n- Turn on all taps and showers—water pressure, hot water function, drainage\n- Flush all toilets\n- Test all electrical sockets and switches\n- Check air conditioning systems (where included)\n- Verify heating system operation\n- Test appliances if included (oven, hob, refrigerator, washing machine)\n\n**Documentation Check**\nBefore completion, verify you receive:\n- Original certificate of habitation (cédula de habitabilidad)\n- Building guarantee certificate\n- Electrical and gas installation certificates (if applicable)\n- Plumbing certification (if required by region)\n- Appliance manuals and warranties\n- Keys and entry instructions\n- Utility meter readings for electricity and water\n- Building maintenance manual and emergency contact information\n\n**Site Condition**\nInspect the wider development:\n- Common areas (entrance, pools, gardens, parking) are complete\n- Landscaping is finished (or timeline is clear)\n- No ongoing construction affecting your enjoyment\n- Parking spaces are clearly allocated\n- Access routes are safe and well-maintained\n\n**Professional Inspection Strongly Recommended**\nDon't rely only on your own walkthrough. Hire a surveyor or professional snagger to identify issues you might miss. This typically costs €200-400 and is money extremely well spent—they catch structural problems, hidden water damage, and system defects you wouldn't see in a casual viewing."

        "title": "Key Ready Price Ranges by Area: 2026 Market Overview",
        "content": "Key ready property prices in Costa Blanca vary significantly by location, property type, and size. Here's typical pricing for 2-3 bedroom properties:\n\n**Most Affordable Areas**\nTorrevieja and inland towns: €170,000-€250,000\n- Modern apartments with pools and parking\n- Good for investors targeting holiday rental market\n- Lower price per square meter due to less premium location\n- Strong rental demand offsets lower appreciation\n\n**Moderate Pricing Areas**\nGuardamar, Benidorm, lower Denia: €200,000-€320,000\n- Balance of affordability and location desirability\n- Beach or near-beach locations\n- Good combination of owner-occupier and investor appeal\n- Realistic rental yields (5-8% in good developments)\n\n**Premium Coastal Areas**\nJavea, upper Denia, Altea: €350,000-€600,000\n- Sea views and prestigious locations\n- Higher quality finishes and more exclusive developments\n- Attracts permanent residents prioritizing quality of life\n- Investment appreciation typically stronger than budget developments\n- Rental yields may be lower (3-5%) but quality justifies pricing\n\n**Ultra-Premium Locations**\nTop Javea beachfront, exclusive Altea: €600,000+\n- Exceptional sea views, prime positions, architectural quality\n- Investment focus is appreciation and personal enjoyment\n- Luxury rental market provides 5-8% yields despite high pricing\n\n**What Affects Price Within Each Area**\n- Proximity to beach (€50-150k premium)\n- Sea views (€75-200k+ premium depending on quality)\n- Pool and parking included (€30-50k value)\n- Furnished vs unfurnished (€20-60k difference)\n- Building age and finish standards (newer/better costs more)\n- Developer reputation (established builders command premium)\n- Orientation and natural light (affects desirability)\n\n**Price Trends**\nKey ready properties have appreciated 8-12% annually in good locations over the past 3-5 years, driven by increased European demand for Spanish coastal property. Costa Blanca benefited from both post-pandemic lifestyle migration and British/Northern European retirees seeking better climate. Appreciation rates are slower in oversupplied budget segments but stronger in premium coastal locations.\n\n**Best Value Currently**\nMid-range properties (€250,000-€400,000) in established towns like Benidorm, Guardamar, and Denia offer best balance of affordability, rental yield, and appreciation potential. Over 5-year holding periods, these have historically outperformed both budget and ultra-luxury segments."

        "title": "The Buying Timeline for Key Ready Properties: Fast Track to Completion",
        "content": "Key ready buying is dramatically faster than off-plan. Here's what to expect:\n\n**Week 1-2: Offer and Reservation**\nYou find a property, negotiate the price, and place a reservation. Most developers require a reservation fee (€3,000-8,000) held in escrow. This takes the property off the market and gives you time for inspections and legal review.\n\n**Week 3-4: Legal Review and Due Diligence**\nYour lawyer verifies:\n- Original title deeds (escritura)\n- Building license and completion permits\n- Certificate of habitation\n- Building guarantee\n- Outstanding debts (community fees, utilities)\n- That the property matches the contract description\n\nYou conduct professional snagging inspection and agree on any remedial works needed before completion.\n\n**Week 5-6: Contract Signing and Final Payment**\nYou sign the purchase contract at a notary and make your final payment (balance of purchase price plus taxes).\n\n**Week 6: Keys and Registration**\nThe notary completes the transaction. You receive keys, original certificates, and the property is registered in your name at the Land Registry (Registro de la Propiedad).\n\n**Total time: 4-6 weeks from reservation to keys in hand.**\n\nComparison:\n- **Off-plan**: 12-24 months construction + 4-6 weeks completion = 12-26 months total\n- **Key ready**: 4-6 weeks total\n- **Resale**: 4-6 weeks total (though negotiations can extend this)\n\nThe speed advantage of key ready is substantial. You can complete a purchase and move in or start renting within weeks. This is critical for investors needing rapid turnover or buyers wanting immediate occupancy.\n\n**Factors That Can Speed or Slow the Timeline**\n- Documentation completeness (missing certificates delay things)\n- Your ability to arrange funds quickly\n- Snagging issues (if any, must be resolved before completion)\n- Mortgage approvals (if financing—can add 2-3 weeks)\n- Notary appointment availability (rarely an issue but occasionally backed up)\n\n**Pro tip**: Have all your funding confirmed and legal representation engaged before placing a reservation. This eliminates potential delays and lets you move quickly once you've found the right property."

        "title": "Financing Key Ready Properties: Mortgages and Payment Options",
        "content": "Financing key ready purchases is typically straightforward:\n\n**Mortgage Pre-Approval**\nBefore making an offer, arrange mortgage pre-approval from a lender. Most Spanish banks (BBVA, Sabadell, CaixaBank) and international lenders (Deutsche Bank, HSBC) offer mortgages for Spanish property:\n- Loan-to-value (LTV): Typically 60-80% of property value\n- Interest rates: Currently 3.5-5% for fixed rates (2026)\n- Terms: 15-25 years standard\n- Lender fees: Arrangement fee (typically 0.5-1% of loan), valuation fee (€200-400)\n\nKey ready properties are easier to finance than off-plan because lenders can inspect completed work. Approval is typically faster.\n\n**The Payment Structure**\nUnlike off-plan properties with staged payments, key ready purchases have a simpler structure:\n\n1. **Reservation**: €3,000-8,000 (non-refundable once contract signed)\n2. **Contract signature**: 30% of purchase price minus reservation deposit (usually within 2 weeks)\n3. **Completion at notary**: Remaining 70% of purchase price plus taxes and costs\n\nIf financing:\n- You pay deposit from your own funds\n- Mortgage funds arrive at completion (held by notary)\n- Completion happens once mortgage and all funds are available\n\n**Mortgage Costs (In Addition to Purchase Price)**\n- Arrangement fee: 0.5-1% (€1,500-4,000)\n- Valuation fee: €200-400\n- Legal fees: €500-1,000\n- Mortgage insurance (if LTV >75%): 1-2% of loan amount\n\n**Total finance costs**: Budget 2-4% of property value for all mortgage-related fees.\n\n**Payment Timing Advantage**\nKey ready purchasing aligns perfectly with mortgage disbursement. You're not waiting 12-24 months for construction—you can complete, move in, and integrate the property into your financial plans within weeks. For investors, this means rapid rental income generation.\n\n**Alternative Funding Options**\n- **Cash purchase**: Fastest route, no finance costs, no monthly payments\n- **Bridging loans**: If selling existing property to fund new purchase, short-term option\n- **International mortgages**: UK, German, or other international banks can finance Spanish purchases\n- **Developer financing**: Some offer in-house financing options (less common for key ready)\n\n**Lender Requirements**\nMost lenders require:\n- Proof of income (payslips, tax returns, business accounts)\n- Deposit (typically 20-40% of property price from your funds)\n- Satisfactory property valuation\n- Personal guarantees from borrowers\n- Property insurance (mandatory with mortgage)\n\nFor self-employed or retirees, documentation requirements can be stricter but are manageable. Speak with lenders early to understand specific requirements—different lenders have different criteria."

        "title": "Key Ready for Investment: Immediate Rental Income Advantage",
        "content": "Key ready properties are especially attractive for property investors because of immediate income generation:\n\n**The Investment Timeline Advantage**\nOff-plan investor timeline:\n- Month 0: Purchase contract signed\n- Month 12-24: Waiting for construction completion\n- Month 24: Finally complete purchase\n- Month 24+: Begin renting (24+ months of zero income)\n\nKey ready investor timeline:\n- Week 0: Purchase contract signed\n- Week 4-6: Complete purchase, receive keys\n- Week 5-6: Upload property to rental platforms, first guests arriving\n- Week 6+: Generating rental income immediately (50+ weeks of income vs. off-plan investors)\n\nOver a 5-year holding period, this timing difference is enormous. Key ready generates income from month 1; off-plan from month 24+. Assuming €500/night average rental rate:\n- Off-plan investor: ~€90,000 lost rental income in years 1-2\n- Key ready investor: €91,000 rental income from year 1\n- **Difference: €181,000 in accumulated income advantage**\n\n**Furnished Options**\nMany key ready developments sell with furnishings included. This adds investment advantage:\n- No delay for furniture purchasing and delivery\n- Can list immediately (furnishings are major appeal for holidaymakers)\n- Lower upfront capital required\n- Furnished properties command 15-30% rental premium\n\n**Rental Income Potential by Area (2026 averages)**\nAssuming 35-40 weeks/year occupancy (typical for holiday rentals):\n\n**Torrevieja**: €400-550/night furnished = €6,000-8,800/month = €72,000-105,600/year\nYield on €220,000 property: 33-48%\n\n**Guardamar**: €450-600/night furnished = €6,750-9,000/month = €81,000-108,000/year\nYield on €280,000 property: 29-39%\n\n**Javea**: €600-900/night furnished = €9,000-13,500/month = €108,000-162,000/year\nYield on €450,000 property: 24-36%\n\n**Benidorm**: €380-520/night furnished = €5,700-7,800/month = €68,400-93,600/year\nYield on €250,000 property: 27-37%\n\nThese are gross rental income estimates. Net yield (after costs) is typically 60-70% of gross. Annual costs include property management (8-12% of revenue), utilities, community fees, maintenance, insurance, and cleaning between guests.\n\n**Investment Strategy Recommendations**\n\n**High-yield segment** (€170,000-€280,000):\n- Best for investors prioritizing cash yield\n- Holiday rental demand strong and relatively stable\n- Lower property costs mean better ROI on capital\n- Higher occupancy rates due to competitive pricing\n- Consider: Development must have pool and parking to justify pricing\n\n**Balanced segment** (€280,000-€450,000):\n- Properties in established towns (Benidorm, Denia, Guardamar)\n- Good combination of yield and appreciation\n- More established infrastructure and guest base\n- Professional management easier to arrange\n- Typically 4-6% net yield + appreciation\n\n**Premium segment** (€450,000+):\n- Javea and Altea sea view properties\n- Lower percentage yield but higher absolute return\n- Strong appreciation potential\n- Attracts quality guests at premium rates\n- Consider: Longer hold periods for appreciation, not just yield\n\n**Risk Mitigation for Investors**\n- Rent from established, reputable developers (lower defect risk)\n- Use professional property management (€100-200/month)\n- Maintain 3-month operating reserve\n- Ensure full insurance coverage\n- Consider 20-25 year hold minimum (property matures with investment)\n- Diversify (don't put all capital in one development)"

        "title": "Common Pitfalls When Buying Key Ready Properties",
        "content": "Learn from others' mistakes:\n\n**Skipping professional inspection**: Assuming key ready means perfect. Some buyers skip snagging inspections to save €300, then discover €5,000 in defects post-completion. Professional inspection is cheap insurance.\n\n**Not verifying the certificate of habitation**: This is the most critical document. A property without a valid cédula de habitabilidad is not legally habitable. You cannot register utilities, get insurance, or legally live there. Never complete without this certificate verified and in hand.\n\n**Not getting independent legal representation**: Using the developer's lawyer or no lawyer at all. Your lawyer represents only your interests. This costs 0.8-1.2% of purchase price but identifies and prevents costly errors.\n\n**Assuming furniture condition**: If buying furnished, don't assume it's in perfect condition. Furniture that looked great in showroom photos can be worn with use. Have condition verified before completion.\n\n**Underestimating completion costs**: Not factoring in taxes, legal fees, notary costs, and mortgage fees when budgeting. These add 12-15% above purchase price. Underestimating leaves you short at completion.\n\n**Not checking community fees and outstanding debts**: Sometimes properties have outstanding community maintenance fees or utility bills from developer's occupation. The seller must clear these, but verify they're paid before completion.\n\n**Choosing purely on price**: Buying the cheapest option in a development. Better to buy the best unit in a quality development than the worst unit in a cheap one. Quality compounds over time.\n\n**Not arranging financing early**: Waiting until ready to complete to arrange a mortgage. Pre-approval in week 1 keeps the timeline on track. Last-minute financing can slip timelines.\n\n**Ignoring title searches**: Verifying title thoroughly. Rarely, properties have legal claims or liens. Your lawyer checks this, but pay attention to findings.\n\n**Not understanding what's included**: Assuming appliances, parking, pool access—all are included when they might be optional upgrades. Get everything in writing.\n\n**Inadequate insurance**: Completing without arranging property insurance. With a mortgage, insurance is mandatory. Without one, it's not legally required but is strongly recommended. Any damage becomes your problem.\n\n**Overcommitting to rentals**: Investors sometimes promise 100% occupancy or specific rental rates without realistic planning. Key ready properties do rent well, but assume 35-40 weeks occupied and 60-70% of gross income as net."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between key ready and move-in ready?",
        "answer": "They're the same thing. 'Key ready' and 'move-in ready' both describe fully completed properties with all systems functioning, inspected and certified, ready for immediate occupancy. In Spanish, it's 'llave en mano.'"
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can I move into a key ready property?",
        "answer": "Completion typically takes 4-6 weeks from reservation to keys in hand. Once you have keys, you can move in immediately. Compare this to off-plan (12-24 months) or resales (4-6 weeks but with higher defect risk)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a certificate of habitation (cédula de habitabilidad)?",
        "answer": "It's a legal certificate from regional authorities confirming the property complies with building codes and is safe and legal to occupy. It's essential—without it, you cannot legally live in the property, register utilities, or get insurance. Always verify this certificate exists before completing."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I customize a key ready property?",
        "answer": "No. Key ready properties are completed as-is. What you see is what you get. If you want renovations or customizations, you'll arrange and pay for those after purchase. Off-plan offers much greater customization options."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are key ready properties more expensive than off-plan?",
        "answer": "Yes, typically 10-15% more expensive than off-plan launch pricing. You're paying for certainty, immediacy, and the ability to see and inspect the finished property. It's a reasonable premium for these advantages."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I check during a key ready property inspection?",
        "answer": "Hire a professional snagger to inspect all systems (plumbing, electrical, heating), finishes, appliances, and structural condition. Key items: verify certificate of habitation, test all utilities, check for small defects, and confirm everything in the contract is present and working."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I get a mortgage for a key ready property?",
        "answer": "Yes, mortgages for key ready properties are typically easier to arrange than off-plan because lenders can inspect completed work. Most Spanish banks and international lenders offer mortgages at 60-80% LTV, 3.5-5% interest rates. Pre-approval in week 1 keeps your timeline on track."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are key ready properties good for investment?",
        "answer": "Excellent for investment. Unlike off-plan (which takes 12-24 months to complete), key ready generates rental income from week 1. You can list furnished properties and have guests arriving within days. Annual gross yields range 20-45% depending on location, though net yield (after costs) is typically 10-25%."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I find defects during inspection?",
        "answer": "Document all issues in writing with photos. The developer should remedy these before you complete. Your lawyer holds back a portion of final payment until snagging items are resolved. Professional snagging (€200-400) typically identifies issues worth far more than the inspection cost."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a lawyer to buy a key ready property?",
        "answer": "Yes, independent legal representation is essential. Your lawyer verifies title, building permits, certificates, outstanding debts, and contract terms. They protect your interests throughout. Budget 0.8-1.2% of purchase price—not an expense to skip."
      },
      {
        "question": "What taxes apply to key ready property purchases?",
        "answer": "New builds attract 10% IVA (VAT) plus 1.5% AJD (stamp duty) = 11.5% total. Add legal fees (1%), notary (0.5%), and registry fees (0.3%) for total costs around 13-15% above purchase price. Budget accordingly in your funding plan."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do key ready prices compare across Costa Blanca areas?",
        "answer": "Torrevieja: €170-250k. Guardamar: €200-320k. Benidorm: €200-450k. Denia: €280-500k. Javea: €350-700k+. Altea: €350-600k+. Prices vary by property type, size, amenities, and view. Furnished properties typically cost €20-60k more."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens after I receive the keys?",
        "answer": "Once you have keys, you can move in immediately or arrange rental management if investing. You'll register utilities (electricity, water, gas) in your name, activate insurance, and update the address with relevant authorities if becoming a resident. Your lawyer handles most registration."
