    "quickAnswer": "Spain's 2024 anti-squatter law strengthened protections for new builds. Express eviction procedures (desahucio exprés) now protect primary and secondary residences, taking 4-6 weeks vs 4-6 months for traditional eviction. Prevention: alarm systems, community vigilance, security cameras, insurance. New builds are safer than established properties due to active communities and builder involvement.",
    "intro": "The issue of illegal occupants (squatters, known as 'okupas' in Spanish) is a serious concern for Spanish property owners, particularly those with vacant or recently completed properties. Spain has gained an unfortunate reputation for lenient squatter laws, but this changed significantly with legal reforms in 2024. This comprehensive guide explains the current situation, your legal protections, the express eviction procedure for new builds, prevention strategies, and what to do if squatters enter your property.",

            "heading": "The Historical Context: Why Spain Had a Squatter Problem",
            "content": "Until recently, Spain had some of Europe's most lenient squatter laws. This created an environment where illegal occupation was surprisingly common:\n\n**Root Causes**:\n\n1. **Housing Crisis**: Spain's 2008-2015 economic collapse left many properties abandoned. Millions of Spaniards lost homes to foreclosure, creating demand for alternative housing.\n\n2. **Long Eviction Process**: Traditional eviction (desahucio ordinario) took 6-12 months because squatters had full tenant rights even though they didn't have contracts. Courts treated them as tenants, requiring lengthy legal procedures.\n\n3. **Criminal Law Gap**: Breaking and entering was criminalized, but once someone was inside, removing them became a civil matter requiring the slow court process.\n\n4. **Activist Movement**: Organized squatter movements (okupación activista) made occupation a political statement, particularly in Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia.\n\n5. **Vacant Properties**: Estimated 3-4 million vacant properties in Spain created easy targets. New builds in particular were attractive—complete, safe, but empty.\n\n**The Okupation Problem**:\n\nBy 2015-2020, illegal occupation had become widespread:\n- Thousands of buildings occupied annually\n- Some properties occupied for 3+ years before eviction\n- Costa Blanca resort areas saw seasonal occupation\n- New build properties vulnerable during construction and post-completion phases\n- International investors losing confidence in Spanish property purchases\n\n**The 2024 Reform**:\n\nFacing growing pressure from property owners and international buyers, Spain passed urgent reforms to its criminal and civil procedures, specifically creating the **express eviction procedure (desahucio exprés)** for properties that qualify."

            "heading": "The 2024 Legal Reforms: What Changed",
            "content": "In 2024, Spain enacted significant anti-squatter reforms (modifications to the Civil Procedure Law and Criminal Code):\n\n**Key Changes**:\n\n**1. Express Eviction Procedure (Desahucio Exprés)**:\n- Created a fast-track court process for certain property types\n- Takes 4-6 weeks instead of 4-6 months\n- Requires only proof of ownership and illegal occupation, not lengthy court disputes\n- Significantly lower legal costs (€500-1,500 vs €2,000-5,000)\n\n**2. Expanded Property Types Covered**:\n- Primary residence (vivienda principal) of owner\n- Secondary residence (vivienda secundaria) of owner (NEW)\n- Owner-occupied commercial properties\n- Properties with violence or criminal activity\n\n**3. Criminal Penalties Increased**:\n- Illegal occupation now explicitly criminalized\n- Penalties up to €1,000 for occupation without forced entry\n- Up to €3,000 for breaking and entering to occupy\n- Police can now intervene on the day of discovery\n\n**4. Police Authority Expanded**:\n- Police can now remove squatters without waiting for court order (in emergency situations)\n- Criminal complaint triggers police investigation\n- Faster intervention in cases of violence or safety risk\n\n**5. Evidence Standards Lowered**:\n- Simple proof of ownership (deed/registry) plus police report of occupation\n- No need to prove formal lease was required\n- Burden on squatter to prove legal right (reversed from before)\n\n**What This Means for New Build Owners**:\n\n- Your new build is eligible for express eviction\n- If you register the property in your name at Land Registry (Registro de la Propiedad), you have legal proof of ownership\n- Upon discovering occupation, file a criminal complaint (denuncia) with police\n- Police investigate and provide report\n- File express eviction case with court\n- 4-6 weeks later, you have court order for eviction\n- Sheriff enforces eviction\n\n**Limitation**: The reformed procedures still require a court order—police cannot simply remove squatters without it. But the court process is now dramatically faster."

            "heading": "Natural Protections: New Build Advantages",
            "content": "New build properties in residential communities have several inherent protections against squatting:\n\n**1. Active Developer/Community Management**:\n\nNew builds are typically in organized residential communities (urbanizaciones) with:\n- Professional property manager (administrador de comunidad)\n- Security gates and controlled access\n- Regular community inspections\n- List of legitimate residents\n- Community vigilance (neighbors notice strangers)\n\nContrast: Old isolated villas or apartments in dispersed neighborhoods lack these oversight mechanisms. A squatter can occupy a vacant old building for months before anyone notices.\n\n**2. Recent Construction = Recent Registration**:\n\nNew builds are registered at the Land Registry (Registro de la Propiedad) within weeks of completion:\n- You have official deed (escritura) within 2-4 weeks of closing\n- Property is recorded with your name as owner\n- This proof of ownership is exactly what express eviction requires\n\nOld properties with unclear title or disputed ownership complicate eviction. New builds have crystal-clear ownership.\n\n**3. Builder Involvement**:\n\nDuring first 5 years after completion, builder typically:\n- Monitors properties under warranty\n- Maintains common areas\n- Coordinates with community administrator\n- May provide security\n- May notify owner of irregularities\n\nThis ongoing involvement creates natural surveillance.\n\n**4. Sophisticated Access Control**:\n\nNew residential communities typically have:\n- Electronic gate systems with codes/cards\n- Video intercoms at unit entrances\n- Keycard or fingerprint locks (some luxury communities)\n- Controlled parking (visitors must be registered)\n\nBreaking in requires more effort, making properties less attractive to squatters.\n\n**5. Alarm Systems**:\n\nMost new builds can accommodate modern alarm systems (see Prevention section). Many owners install:\n- Motion detectors\n- Door/window sensors\n- Remote monitoring\n- Police call capability\n\nSquatters avoid alarmed properties—high risk of police response.\n\n**6. Occupied Community**:\n\nIn established residential communities:\n- Many properties are owner-occupied or properly rented\n- Active residents notice strangers\n- Community administrator makes regular rounds\n- Maintenance staff familiar with property occupants\n\nOccupation is difficult to hide. Compare to abandoned industrial building or remote villa—no one watching.\n\n**7. Insurance Knowledge**:\n\nNew build buyers are typically recent purchasers who:\n- Have active insurance policies\n- Maintain regular contact with insurers\n- Know they must report incidents\n- Understand coverage for illegal occupation\n\nOld property owners sometimes don't have insurance or don't update it. They're less likely to know about squatters quickly."

Delays make eviction harder.\n\n**Step 1: Verify the Occupation (Do NOT Confront Squatters)**\n\nDangers of confrontation:\n- Squatters may become aggressive or violent\n- You may be injured\n- Criminal liability could fall on you (self-defense laws are complex)\n- Property damage can escalate\n- Police prefer you to report rather than intervene\n\n**Safe verification methods**:\n- Look through windows/door\n- Check for vehicles, lights, belongings\n- Ask neighbors if they've seen activity\n- Review security camera footage remotely\n- Call community administrator for observation\n- **Do NOT enter the property alone**\n\n**Step 2: Contact Police (File a Denuncia)**\n\nImmediately call **091 (National Police)** or **092 (Local Police)**:\n\n1. **Explain situation**:\n   - \"There are people illegally occupying my property at [address]\"\n   - Provide property address, your name, ownership documentation\n   - State whether squatters are aggressive/dangerous\n\n2. **Police will**:\n   - Send officers to assess situation\n   - Prepare a police report (atestado/denuncia)\n   - May remove squatters if safety issue or breaking/entering occurred (varies by jurisdiction)\n   - Provide you with a police report (essential for your case)\n\n3. **You must**:\n   - Provide proof of ownership (deed, registry certificate)\n   - Show property address matches your deed\n   - Cooperate fully with police\n   - Get a copy of the police report (número de denuncia)\n\n**Critical**: Request express eviction (desahucio exprés) when filing the complaint. Not all police understand the new procedures—you may need to specifically request the fast-track process.\n\n**Step 3: Document Everything**\n\n- Take photos/videos of occupied property\n- Document vehicle(s), belongings, extent of occupation\n- Note date and time discovered\n- Keep all communications (police report, text messages, emails)\n- Photograph any property damage\n- Keep receipts for any expenses incurred\n\n**Step 4: Contact a Lawyer (Immediately)**\n\nWithin 24-48 hours:\n\n1. **Find a lawyer specializing in real estate/eviction**:\n   - Call the local Bar Association (Colegio de Abogados)\n   - Ask for lawyers experienced in express eviction (desahucio exprés)\n   - Get quotes (typical: €800-2,000 for express case)\n\n2. **Provide lawyer with**:\n   - Police report with denuncia number\n   - Deed/property registry certificate\n   - Photos of occupation\n   - Any communications with squatters (if written)\n   - Your contact information\n\n3. **Lawyer will**:\n   - File express eviction case with court (juzgado de instrucción)\n   - Request temporary protective measures if needed\n   - Expedite the case\n   - Handle all court communications\n\n**Step 5: Avoid Self-Help Eviction**\n\n**NEVER attempt to**:\n- Change locks while squatters are inside (illegal eviction, criminal liability)\n- Remove their belongings (property theft)\n- Cut off utilities (illegal in Spain)\n- Physically remove them (assault charges possible)\n- Threaten or harass them (criminal harassment)\n- Hire private security to remove them (vigilantism, illegal)\n\nSpain's law requires judicial eviction even for clear-cut illegal occupation.

    "conclusion": "Spain's 2024 anti-squatter law reforms have dramatically improved protections for property owners. Express eviction procedures now resolve illegal occupation in 4-6 weeks instead of 4-6 months. New build properties are inherently safer due to community oversight, professional management, and clear ownership registration. The best protection strategy combines physical security (alarms, cameras, locks), community engagement (neighbors, administration), and comprehensive insurance. Tier 2 protection (moderate investment: €4,000 initial, €110/month ongoing) is appropriate for most Costa Blanca new builds and provides 90-95% risk reduction. If you're a non-resident owner, professional monitoring and property checks are essential. While squatting remains a concern in some areas, modern law and technology have made successful illegal occupation increasingly difficult for determined property owners. Act early with protection measures—prevention is far easier and cheaper than dealing with occupation after it happens.\n\nNeed help navigating the process?
