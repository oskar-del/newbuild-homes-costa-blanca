            "heading": "Structure: Escuela Pública, Concertado, and Privada",
            "content": "Spain's education system comprises three types of schools: (1) Escuela pública (state school): Free public schools funded by the government, following the Spanish national curriculum and taught in Spanish (with regional languages like Valenciano in the Valencia region). These are excellent for integration into Spanish society but may challenge families with limited Spanish. (2) Escuela concertada (charter school): Schools partially funded by government and partially by fees, following Spanish curriculum but sometimes offering additional bilingual or specialized programs. Fees are modest (€1,000–€2,500/year). These are popular with Spanish families seeking more specialized education. (3) Escuela privada (private school): Fully privately funded schools that may follow alternative curricula (British, American, IB) and offer instruction in English or multiple languages. Fees are €4,000–€12,000+ annually. These serve primarily international and affluent Spanish families. International schools fall into the private category, though a few high-quality concertado schools offer bilingual or international programs at lower cost. For expat families seeking English-medium education, private international schools are the typical choice."

            "content": "Spanish schools operate on a different calendar than UK or American schools. The school year runs September through June, divided into three terms: Term 1 (September–December, 13 weeks), Term 2 (January–March, 12 weeks), Term 3 (April–June, 8–10 weeks). Summer holiday is July and August (7–8 weeks). Christmas and Easter breaks align roughly with UK schools but are slightly different. This means families transitioning from UK schools have summer break synchronized with global travel periods (July–August), though Easter holidays occur a week or two after UK Easter. Spanish schools typically have additional holiday days (Valenciano regional holidays, local municipal days) that vary by location. International schools often align school holidays with UK/American schedules to facilitate student exchanges and family travel."

            "heading": "Spanish Learning and Curriculum Adaptation",
            "content": "Even at international schools emphasizing English, Spanish language instruction is compulsory. Most international schools require Spanish from age 3–4 onwards, with increasing depth through secondary level. Spanish is taught as a subject (classes in Spanish grammar, literature, history) and is often the language of administration (announcements, school documents). For younger children (ages 3–7), learning Spanish typically progresses naturally; most acquire conversational Spanish within 6–12 months of enrollment. For teenagers arriving without Spanish, the adjustment is more challenging; many international schools offer Spanish as a Second Language (SSL) support. Families should assess their children's readiness and desire to learn Spanish—some expat families prioritize English-only education, while others view Spanish acquisition as a valuable benefit of living in Spain."

IGCSE is globally recognized and facilitates university entry in the UK, USA, and other countries. (3) Sixth Form (ages 16–18): Students study A-Levels in 3–4 subjects of their choice. A-Levels are the traditional UK university entrance qualification. Schools following this curriculum prepare students for UK universities.

(3) Diploma Program (DP, ages 16–18): Rigorous two-year program requiring students to complete six subjects, extended essays, creativity/action/service (CAS) components, and theory of knowledge (TOK) courses. IB is highly respected globally and is an alternative to A-Levels, facilitating university entry worldwide. The IB emphasizes critical thinking, global awareness, and multilingualism—valuable skills in an interconnected world. Schools offering IB typically charge higher fees (€7,000–€12,000+) but provide comprehensive, internationally recognized education.

(2) Bilingual programs: Some schools (Colegio Jávea, Colegio Inglés Orihuela Costa) operate bilingual curricula with significant instruction in both English and Spanish. This approach supports Spanish language acquisition while maintaining English competency. (3) Spanish integrated programs: Some schools integrate Spanish national curriculum elements alongside English international curriculum. For example, El Limonar balances IB curriculum with some Spanish history, literature, and cultural content. Families must decide their priority: Do they want English-dominant education to facilitate eventual university entry to UK/USA, or do they prioritize Spanish language and integration into Spanish society? Younger children generally acquire Spanish naturally at bilingual schools; older children may struggle if arriving without prior Spanish.

To enroll: (1) Contact the school's admissions office (usually by email to a specific admissions address). (2) Request an admissions information pack. (3) Complete an application form. (4) For ages 4+, most schools conduct entrance assessments in English and Mathematics to assess academic level and determine appropriate grade placement. (5) Schedule an interview with school leadership (head of admissions or school principal). (6) Provide references from previous schools, proof of vaccination/health records, and passport copies. (7) Once accepted, pay an enrollment deposit (typically €500–€1,500) to secure a place. The entire process takes 2–4 weeks. Families relocating should ideally begin the application process 6–8 weeks before desired start date to allow time for assessment and interviews. However, schools often accommodate mid-year joins if capacity exists; families arriving unexpectedly can usually find places, though not always at their first-choice school."

These are embedded into the curriculum at no additional charge and focus on improving academic English vocabulary and written/oral communication. Spanish Language Support (SSL) is similarly available for new arrivals; Spanish-language instruction progresses from conversational to academic levels. Students typically acquire conversational Spanish (sufficient for social interaction and basic classes) within 6–12 months; academic Spanish proficiency develops over 2–3 years.

Schools do not typically require visas for enrollment; schools and parents are responsible for ensuring appropriate residency status. International families relocating to Spain need a long-stay visa (D visa) for stays exceeding 90 days, obtained from Spanish immigration authorities. School enrollment does not automatically grant visa eligibility, though enrollment may be referenced in visa applications to demonstrate intent to reside. Families should consult Spanish immigration and their respective consulates regarding visa requirements; schools' admissions teams typically have experience advising international families on visa matters."

    "conclusion": "Choosing a school for your family relocating to the Costa Blanca is one of the most important decisions you will make. The region boasts excellent international schools at various price points and with diverse curricula, from traditional British IGCSE/A-Levels to the internationally renowned IB program. Whether you settle in the southern developments of Torrevieja and Orihuela Costa or the northern charm of Javea, Benidorm, or Calpe, you will find quality educational options for your children. Consider school preferences alongside property location—the best home is one positioned conveniently near excellent schools your children will thrive in. Budget €5,000–€12,000 annually per child for international school fees, and factor this into your overall cost of living in Spain. Visit schools, speak with current parents, assess community fit, and ensure the educational philosophy aligns with your family values and your children's needs. A good school is not just about academics but about nurturing confident, capable, internationally minded young people. The Costa Blanca's international schools, supported by professional educators and diverse, experienced communities, are well-equipped to provide exactly that."
