    "quickAnswer": "A couple can live comfortably in Costa Blanca for €1,800-2,500/month including housing, food, utilities, and entertainment. Budget-conscious retirees manage on €1,400/month; those seeking more luxury spend €3,000-3,500. This is 25-40% less than equivalent living in the UK, Germany, or Scandinavia.",
    "intro": "The cost of living question is always the first one: \"Can I afford to live in Spain?\" The short answer for Costa Blanca is almost certainly yes—and probably more comfortably than wherever you're coming from.\n\nBut vague reassurances don't help you plan. This guide provides real, specific numbers based on current 2026 costs. We've gathered data from expat residents, checked supermarket prices, called utilities providers, and verified everything against daily life on the ground.\n\nThese figures focus on Costa Blanca South (Torrevieja, Orihuela Costa, inland areas) where most international buyers settle. Costa Blanca North costs approximately 10-15% more.",

        "title": "Housing Costs: Rent vs Own",
        "content": "Your biggest expense, whether renting or owning:\n\n**Rental costs (monthly)**:\n- 2-bed apartment (inland): €500-700\n- 2-bed apartment (coastal): €650-900\n- 3-bed townhouse: €700-1,000\n- 3-bed villa with pool: €900-1,400\n- Luxury villa: €1,500-2,500+\n\nRental costs have risen since 2020, with strong demand from both long-term residents and digital nomads. Summer (short-term) rentals cost significantly more.\n\n**Ownership costs (monthly)**:\nIf you own your property outright, ongoing costs include:\n- Community fees: €50-150\n- IBI (property tax): €40-100\n- Insurance: €30-50\n- Maintenance reserve: €100-200\n- Pool maintenance: €80-150 (if private)\n- **Total: €300-650/month**\n\n**Mortgage scenario**:\nA €250,000 mortgage at 3.5% over 25 years costs approximately €1,250/month. Add running costs for total housing cost of €1,600-1,900/month.\n\n**The bottom line**: Owning outright drops housing costs dramatically. Many retirees sell UK/Northern European properties, buy Costa Blanca homes for less, and pocket the difference—eliminating housing costs from their monthly budget."

        "content": "Utilities in Spain are reasonable, though summer air conditioning adds up:\n\n**Electricity (monthly)**:\n- Winter (heating): €60-100\n- Summer (AC): €100-180\n- Spring/Autumn: €40-60\n- Average over year: €70-100\n\nTips: LED lighting, efficient appliances, and strategic AC use (evening hours) reduce bills significantly. Solar panels are increasingly popular.\n\n**Water (monthly)**:\n- Typical usage: €25-40\n- With garden irrigation: €40-70\n- Pool top-ups included above\n\nWater is more expensive than in northern Europe due to scarcity. Efficient irrigation and pool covers help.\n\n**Gas (monthly)**:\n- If on mains gas: €20-40\n- Bottled gas (bombona): €15-30\n\nMany properties use electric for everything. Bottled gas is common for cooking in older properties.\n\n**Internet + Mobile**:\n- Fiber internet (300Mbps): €35-50\n- Mobile plan (unlimited calls, 20GB): €15-25\n- Combined packages: €50-70\n\nExcellent fiber coverage in most areas. Providers include Movistar, Orange, Vodafone, and budget options like Digi.\n\n**Total utilities: €150-280/month** depending on property size, AC usage, and habits."

Torrevieja's Friday market, Villamartin Sunday market, and similar events are social occasions as well as shopping opportunities.\n\n**Eating out**:\n- Menu del día (3-course lunch): €10-14\n- Tapas evening (per person): €15-25\n- Restaurant dinner: €20-35\n- Coffee: €1.20-1.80\n- Beer/wine: €2-4\n\nDining out is affordable enough to be a regular habit rather than a treat."

    "conclusion": "Living in Costa Blanca is genuinely affordable—and the value extends beyond simple cost savings. You're not just spending less; you're living better. The climate means lower heating costs and an outdoor lifestyle. The food quality is excellent at lower prices. The pace of life is healthier and less stressful.\n\nFor a couple owning their property outright, comfortable living costs €1,800-2,500/month. That's €21,600-30,000/year for a lifestyle that would cost significantly more in Northern Europe—with more sunshine, better food, and less stress.\n\nThe question isn't whether you can afford Costa Blanca. It's whether you can afford not to consider it.",
