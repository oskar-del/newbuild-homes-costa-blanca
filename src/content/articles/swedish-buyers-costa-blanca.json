Torrevieja became the largest Swedish community outside Sweden, creating established infrastructure (services, community, culture) that attracts continued Swedish investment. The climate (sun, warmth) contrasts dramatically with Nordic winters."

        "question": "How is rental income taxed for Swedish property owners?",
        "answer": "Spanish property rental income is taxed in Spain at 19-45% depending on your income bracket. Can deduct expenses (maintenance, management, depreciation at 3%/year). Sweden-Spain treaty prevents double taxation. Sweden doesn't tax the same income again if taxed in Spain. Rental income reduces some tax benefits but creates deductible expenses."

        "question": "What's the currency risk for SEK/EUR transactions?",

Use specialist FX brokers (Wise, OFX) instead of banks (saves €3,000-6,000 on large transfers). Consider forward contracts for certainty, or spread transfers over time to average rates."
