        "title": "Town Overview",
        "content": "Finestrat's geography creates its distinctive character—the town sits directly inland from Benidorm beaches yet maintains separate administrative identity and distinct community character. The proximity creates convenient access to Benidorm's infrastructure (shopping, dining, entertainment, beaches) while enabling Finestrat residents to avoid Benidorm's tourist congestion and higher prices.\n\nThe Puig Campana mountain (1,410 meters elevation) dominates the inland landscape, creating dramatic visual backdrop and defining geographic identity. The mountain provides abundant hiking opportunities, ranging from moderate family walks to challenging alpine routes. Clear Mediterranean days enable visibility extending 100+ kilometers, with coastal vistas and inland mountain ranges visible from elevated positions.\n\nThe town's rapid development over past 15-20 years transformed it from agricultural village to suburban residential community while preserving distinct character. Modern urbanizaciones (residential developments) coexist with traditional village core. This mixture appeals to families seeking contemporary amenities combined with village community feel.\n\nFinestrat benefits from Mediterranean climate—300+ sunshine days annually, summer averages 28-30°C, winter averages 12-15°C. Protected positioning by surrounding mountains provides wind protection while maintaining excellent weather. The town's elevation (approximately 60 meters in town center, rising inland) creates slightly cooler temperatures than Benidorm beach level."

        "title": "Property Market",
        "content": "Finestrat's property market spans €180,000-€500,000, offering value compared to established premium markets:\n\n**Budget Properties (€180,000-€280,000)**: One-to-two bedroom apartments and modest townhouses in established neighborhoods. Many feature earlier construction (1990s-2000s) with functional rather than premium finishes. These appeal to first-time buyers, holiday rental investors, and value-conscious purchasers. Properties support €600-€1,200 monthly rental income off-season, €1,200-€2,000 during peak season—generating 4-5% gross rental yields.\n\n**Standard Residences (€280,000-€400,000)**: Two-to-three bedroom townhouses, apartments, and villas throughout established neighborhoods. Core market serving professional families and Spanish residents. Modern construction with current amenities predominates. Properties support €1,000-€1,600 weekly rental rates during peak season, generating 4-5% gross yields.

Mountain view properties command premiums—€40-70 per sqm above equivalent properties without views. The market's evolution from agricultural area to suburban community creates upside potential for investors recognizing growth trajectory."
