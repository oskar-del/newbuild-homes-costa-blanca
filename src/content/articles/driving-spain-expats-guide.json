    "quickAnswer": "EU driving licenses are valid in Spain for 2 years; non-EU licenses for 6 months. You can exchange your license at DGT (Dirección General de Tráfico). Buying a car costs €4,000–€50,000+ (new and used options available). Insurance is mandatory (terceros liability minimum €600–€1,000/year). Spanish traffic rules include 50 km/h in towns, 100 km/h on normal roads, 120 km/h on motorways.",
    "intro": "For expats relocating to the Costa Blanca, owning a car is often essential for commuting, exploring the region, and enjoying the Mediterranean lifestyle. However, driving in Spain involves navigating different rules, licensing requirements, insurance obligations, and car purchase processes compared to your home country. This guide provides practical information on driving licenses, buying a car (whether new or used), vehicle registration and inspection (ITV), insurance, traffic rules, common fines, and safety considerations for foreign drivers on the Costa Blanca.",

            "content": "When you first arrive in Spain, you can drive on your valid foreign driving license without immediate legal obligation to exchange it. However, the duration you can drive on a foreign license depends on your citizenship: (1) EU/EEA citizens: Your license is valid for driving in Spain for 2 years from when you establish residency in Spain. (2) Non-EU citizens: Your license is valid for 6 months from arrival in Spain. (3) International Driving Permits (IDPs): Citizens of countries not signatory to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals (e.g., Australia, some Asian countries) should obtain an IDP from their home country authorities before arriving. An IDP is a translation of your license and must be accompanied by your original license to be valid in Spain. Most EU licenses (UK, France, Germany, Scandinavia, etc.) are recognized in Spain. Your license must be in good condition and not expired; Spain does not accept expired licenses regardless of citizenship. If your license is in your home-country language (e.g., English), you should carry it along with an official translation into Spanish or carry an IDP, though in practice Spanish police are usually accommodating with EU license holders and do not strictly require translations."

            "content": "At some point during your residency in Spain (ideally within the first 2 years for EU citizens, within 6 months for non-EU citizens), you should exchange your foreign license for a Spanish driving license (permiso de conducción). This is not legally mandatory if you have a valid foreign EU license (you can drive indefinitely in Spain on a valid EU license), but exchanging to a Spanish license is recommended for convenience and proof of Spanish residency. To exchange your license: (1) Visit the DGT (Dirección General de Tráfico) office in your province. On the Costa Blanca, major DGT offices are in Alicante, Torrevieja, Benidorm, and Javea. (2) Complete an application form (Modelo TT.2), available at the DGT or online. (3) Provide: your foreign license (original), passport (original), two passport-size photographs, proof of Spanish residency (empadronamiento—municipal registration, or a utility bill), and a Spanish tax ID number (NIE for foreigners). (4) Pay a processing fee (approximately €25–€35). (5) Take a medical certificate if required (most exchanges for standard categories do not require medical exams unless you have certain health conditions or the original license is very old). The DGT will issue a temporary license on the spot and mail the permanent license within 2–4 weeks. During this period, you can drive using your original foreign license plus the temporary receipt. The entire process takes 30 minutes to 1 hour."

(3) A (motorcycles any size): From age 24 (or 20 with 2-year experience on A1). (4) B (cars up to 3,500 kg): From age 18. Most expats hold a Category B license. (5) C (lorries up to 7,500 kg): From age 18 (for hire), age 21 (professional). (6) D (buses): From age 24. Your foreign license's categories typically transfer directly to the Spanish license without additional testing. However, if your foreign license has restrictions (e.g., 'automatic transmission only'), these carry over to your Spanish license. Category B allows driving cars and light vans and pulling trailers up to a certain weight."

(3) Ages 70+: Valid for 3 years (with more frequent medical examinations required). Renewal requires visiting the DGT with your expiring license, passport, medical certificate (for ages 70+), and payment of a renewal fee (approximately €20–€30). It is advisable to renew your license before it expires; driving on an expired license is illegal and incurs fines. If your Spanish license is approaching expiration, the DGT typically sends renewal information, though you should proactively check the expiration date and schedule renewal in advance."

(2) Used mid-range cars (3–10 years old): €8,000–€20,000. Examples: Peugeot 308, Seat Ibiza, Ford Focus. (3) New economy cars: €12,000–€20,000. (4) New mid-range cars: €20,000–€35,000. (5) Luxury/premium cars: €35,000–€100,000+. Car prices in Spain are generally comparable to other European countries, though some models are more expensive in Spain due to import taxes and local pricing. On the Costa Blanca, both new and used car markets are active. Dealerships (concesionarios) are common, particularly for franchised dealers (Renault, Seat, Peugeot, Ford, etc.), and private sales are also prevalent. Second-hand car markets are robust, with numerous classified websites (milanuncios.com, motos.net, Coches.net) listing private and dealer vehicles."

            "heading": "Buying a New Car",
            "content": "Purchasing a new car from a dealership in Spain is straightforward: (1) Choose your vehicle and negotiate price (dealer discounts of 5–15% below sticker price are common). (2) Agree on specifications (color, options, delivery timeline). (3) Sign a sales contract (contrato de compra-venta) specifying vehicle details, price, delivery date, and payment terms. (4) Typically, a deposit (10–20% of price) is paid upon signing; the balance is paid upon delivery. (5) Arrange financing if needed (see financing section below). (6) The dealer arranges vehicle registration and provides the documentation (title, registration certificate) upon delivery. (7) The dealer registers the car in your name at the municipality's traffic office (jefatura provincial de tráfico) and provides registration plates. Registration and documentation typically take 2–4 weeks after payment. A new car includes warranty (typically 3 years or 100,000 km), roadside assistance (often included), and insurance (initially included in some cases). VAT (IVA, 21% in Spain) is included in the sticker price; you cannot claim VAT back unless you are a VAT-registered business. Purchase price for a new economy car (€15,000) includes approximately €3,150 VAT."

Inspect the car thoroughly, request service history and maintenance records, and test-drive extensively. (2) Verify ownership: Ask the seller for the registration document (título) and ensure they are the registered owner. (3) Check vehicle condition: Have a trusted mechanic inspect the car (inspection costs €80–€150). (4) Negotiate price: Used car prices are negotiable; expect 5–10% discount from asking price. (5) Sign a sales contract: Even private sales should be documented in writing (modelo 030 form, available online). (6) Register the car: Transfer ownership at the municipal traffic office (jefatura provincial de tráfico) by presenting the old registration, new owner information, sales contract, and proof of ITV (see below). Registration transfer costs approximately €100–€200 and takes 1–2 weeks. (7) From a dealer: Dealer purchases offer more protection (warranty, checked condition), but prices are higher. Dealers typically offer 12-month warranties on used cars and handle registration. Used car purchases do not incur VAT on the resale; however, if you buy from a dealer, there may be transfer taxes (variación de titularidad) of approximately 4–8% depending on the municipality."

Foreigners with Spanish NIE and established residence can typically obtain car loans; you may need to provide proof of income and establish a Spanish bank account. (2) Down payment: Most loans require a 10–20% down payment. (3) Loan term: Typically 3–7 years; longer terms mean lower monthly payments but higher total interest. (4) Pre-purchase insurance: Some sellers require proof of insurance before you take possession of the car. You can arrange temporary insurance online (1–3 days) while permanent insurance is being finalized. (5) Tax implications: Car purchases are not subject to transfer tax (unlike property), but registration includes administrative fees (approximately €100–€200).

(3) What is checked: Structural integrity, brakes, lights, steering, suspension, emissions, windscreen, wipers, seatbelts, registration plates, safety equipment (warning triangles, reflective jackets). (4) Cost: Approximately €60–€120 per inspection depending on the testing center (taller de ITV). (5) Pass/fail: If you pass, you receive a certificate valid for 2 years. If you fail, you have 2 months to fix the issues and retest (second test is discounted, approximately €30–€50). (6) Booking: You can book ITV appointments online (e.g., through regional ITV center websites) or in person. Appointment times are available within 1–2 weeks typically. (7) Necessity before purchase: When buying a used car, ensure it has valid ITV; if ITV is expired, you cannot legally drive the car until inspection is completed. As a buyer, request ITV certificate from the seller; if it is expired, budget €60–€120 for inspection as part of your purchase cost."

(4) Passport. (5) Original documents: Sales contract, previous registration certificate (if used car), and ITV certificate. The registration office processes your application and issues the registration certificate and plates within 1–2 weeks. Cars are registered in your personal name; you cannot register a car in your spouse's name unless they also have a Spanish NIE. Some expats register cars in the name of a Spanish business entity; consult a Spanish accountant or lawyer if this is relevant to your situation (e.g., if purchasing a car for a rental business)."

All drivers must have at least liability insurance (Responsabilidad Civil) covering damage to third parties (other vehicles, property, persons). Two main insurance types are offered: (1) Terceros (Liability-only): Basic mandatory insurance covering damage you cause to third parties. Does not cover damage to your own vehicle, theft, vandalism, or accidents where you are at fault. Annual cost: €600–€1,000 for a standard car in most of Spain. (2) Todo Riesgo (Comprehensive): Covers liability to third parties plus damage to your vehicle (accidents, theft, vandalism, weather, natural disasters). Includes additional benefits like roadside assistance, rental car while yours is being repaired, and legal assistance. Annual cost: €1,000–€3,000+ depending on car value, driver age/experience, and deductible (franchise). Comprehensive insurance is recommended for new or financed cars; most lenders require it as a loan condition. For older, low-value cars, liability-only may be economical."

Sports cars and expensive vehicles cost more to insure. (2) Car value: Higher-value cars cost more to insure (for comprehensive coverage). (3) Driver age and experience: Young drivers (under 25) and new drivers (0–3 years experience) pay significantly higher premiums (50–100% more). Drivers over 75 pay higher premiums. (4) Driving record: Clean driving records (no accidents, no fines) result in lower premiums. Each accident increases your premium (up to 50% increase); at-fault accidents increase premiums more than non-fault. (5) Annual mileage: Higher mileage increases premiums (more exposure to risk). (6) Deductible (franchise): Higher deductibles (€300–€1,000) lower premiums but mean you pay more if you have an accident. (7) Claims history: Insurance companies penalize drivers with previous claims. (8) Location: Rural vs. urban areas have different risk profiles; coastal areas like the Costa Blanca may have slightly different rates than inland regions. Example premium: A 40-year-old driver with a clean record insuring a 5-year-old economy car (€12,000 value) with liability-only in the Costa Blanca region would expect to pay €700–€900/year. Comprehensive for the same car/driver would be €1,200–€1,600/year."

(4) Brokers: Insurance brokers (corredores de seguros) can provide quotes from multiple companies. (5) Online comparison: Use comparison sites (rastreator.es, CompareTheMarket.es) to compare quotes across insurers. The process: Provide your information (car details, driver age/experience, driving history, desired coverage), receive quotes, select a policy, pay (usually monthly installments or annual payment), and receive documentation. Most policies include roadside assistance (grúa), legal assistance (asesoramiento legal), and sometimes rental car while yours is repaired.

            "content": "(1) Summer heat: Extreme heat (35–40°C) can cause tire blowouts and engine overheating. Check tire pressure and coolant regularly. (2) Sun glare: Strong Mediterranean sun creates glare on windscreens; sunshades and polarized sunglasses are helpful. (3) Coastal roads: Winding hillside roads (e.g., around Javea, Calpe) require caution; visibility is limited, and tourist drivers may be unfamiliar with roads. (4) Mountain roads: Hairpin turns and steep gradients demand careful speed and gear management; hold brakes and watch for loose gravel. (5) Night driving: Poor street lighting outside town centers; use full-beam headlights when safe. (6) Rain (November–March): Mediterranean rains are occasional but can be heavy; water on roads creates aquaplaning risk. Reduce speed on wet roads. (7) Wildlife: In rural areas, wild boar and other animals can cross roads, especially at dawn/dusk. Be alert. (8) Tourist drivers: During summer, roads are congested with tourist drivers unfamiliar with Spanish roads; expect slower traffic and be patient."

            "content": "Maintain your vehicle to avoid breakdowns and safety issues: (1) Regular servicing: Every 15,000 km or annually, whichever comes first. (2) Tire checks: Check pressure monthly and tread depth (minimum 1.6 mm); replace tires when worn. (3) Brakes: Have brake pads and discs inspected annually. (4) Fluids: Check oil, coolant, brake fluid, and power steering fluid monthly. (5) Battery: In summer heat, batteries deteriorate faster; test annually. (6) Air conditioning: Service air conditioning before summer to ensure cooling. (7) Windscreen wipers: Replace seasonally (winter for rainy season). (8) Lights: Check all lights monthly. Spanish garages (talleres) are available in all towns; costs for servicing are reasonable (€150–€300 for basic service). Major dealerships are more expensive but offer warranty on work."

            "content": "(1) GPS/Sat-nav: Essential for navigating Spanish roads. Use Google Maps, Waze, or Garmin with updated maps. (2) Toll avoidance: Use GPS to identify toll roads and free alternatives. (3) Apps for fines: Use apps (RadarBot, Speedcam Radar) to identify speed cameras and warnings. (4) Fuel planning: Fuel is cheaper at self-service stations; plan refueling to avoid expensive motorway services. Cost is approximately €1.40–€1.60/liter depending on fuel type and station. (5) Breakdown assistance: Join roadside assistance (asisitencia de viaje) through your insurer or independently (RACE, ADA). Costs €50–€150/year and cover vehicle recovery, repairs, and accommodation if stranded. (6) Language: Carry a Spanish-English dictionary or use your phone translator if communicating with police or mechanics."

            "content": "(1) At-the-spot fines: Police may issue on-the-spot fines (multas in situ). You receive a fine receipt and can pay within 15 days at a traffic office or online (descuentos for early payment, typically 50% off). (2) Mailed fines: Some violations result in fines mailed to your address; deadline to pay is usually 30 days. (3) Payment options: Pay at traffic offices (Tráfico), banks, or online (www.dgt.es for online payment). (4) Appeals: If you believe a fine is unjust, you can appeal within 30 days; appeals must be submitted in Spanish, often requiring a lawyer. (5) Non-payment: Failing to pay fines can result in license suspension, vehicle impoundment, or legal proceedings. It is advisable to pay fines promptly. (6) Foreigner identification: If fined and you do not have a Spanish NIE, provide your passport and foreign address; authorities will pursue collection through your home country's authorities (especially EU countries with reciprocal agreements)."
