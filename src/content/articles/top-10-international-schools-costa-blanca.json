    "conclusion": "Costa Blanca offers excellent international school options serving expat families moving to the region. North coast schools (Jávea, Calpe, Altea area) provide premium locations with Mediterranean lifestyle integration. South coast schools (Torrevieja, Orihuela Costa area) offer more affordable options with strong academics. All schools teach in English while developing Spanish language skills, easing the transition for international families.\n\nChoosing the right school depends on family priorities: curriculum preference (British, American, IB, Waldorf), budget constraints, location convenience, facilities quality, extracurricular programs, and long-term plans (university destination, length of stay in Spain). Visiting schools, meeting teachers and current families, and understanding your family's educational values guides the decision.\n\nMost international schools support families in broader Costa Blanca relocation, with many offering host family connections and integration programs. School choice significantly impacts family lifestyle and community integration—selecting the right fit contributes to successful relocation to Costa Blanca.\n\nThinking of making the move to Costa Blanca?

        "question": "Do international schools teach Spanish curriculum?",
        "answer": "Most international schools teach British or American curriculum. Some schools (Newton College, Elian's) integrate Spanish curriculum elements. Students can sit Spanish Bachillerato exams alongside international qualifications. Spanish language is taught at all schools. Spanish curriculum integration helps with Spanish university access."

      },
      {
        "question": "Do international schools accept children with limited English?",

Transition to full English instruction occurs gradually. Schools are experienced with international student integration."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which school is best for university preparation?",
        "answer": "King's College, Newton College, and Lady Elizabeth School excel in university preparation with IB Diploma strength. Sierra Bernia and Phoenix offer Cambridge pathway.
