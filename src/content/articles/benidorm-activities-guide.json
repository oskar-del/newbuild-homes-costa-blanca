        "title": "Theme Parks",
        "content": "Terra Mitica stands as Spain's premier theme park, drawing 2 million annual visitors with 30+ rides and attractions spanning five themed zones representing ancient civilizations (Iberia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, and the Mediterranean). Day entry is €45-60 depending on season, with discounts for advance online bookings and multi-day passes. Fast-pass tickets (€20 extra) bypass waiting lines—essential during July-August when queues exceed 90 minutes for popular rides. The park maintains high ride standards, with roller coasters like Inferno and Sling Shot appealing to thrill-seekers, plus gentler attractions for younger children. Season passes starting at €199 offer excellent value if you plan frequent visits. Mundomar, the park's marine theme attraction, specializes in dolphin and parrot shows, housed in climate-controlled facilities—perfect for beating Benidorm's intense summer heat. Combined Terra Mitica and Mundomar tickets offer better value than purchasing separately. Both parks remain open year-round with reduced hours (usually 2pm-10pm) during shoulder months."

        "title": "Water Parks",
        "content": "Aqualandia remains Europe's most visited water park, sprawling across 80,000 square meters with 16 slides, lazy rivers, and wave pools serving 2.5 million guests annually. Entry costs €32-45 depending on advance booking and season, with serious water park enthusiasts opting for season passes (€119+). Peak season hours (June-September) run 10am-midnight, allowing evening visits when temperatures peak. The park's slide variety suits all courage levels, from the gentle Lazy River to adrenaline-pumping attractions like Kamikaze and Skyscraper. A hidden gem is the Wellness Zone—spa facilities with sauna, jacuzzis, and massage treatments (additional €15-20) offering peaceful respite between water slide marathons. Lockers, towel rentals, and food courts are available, though bringing packed snacks significantly reduces costs. Combine your water park visit with lunch at one of several restaurants—paella and gazpacho naturally complement beach days. The park sells sunscreen (expensive) so bring your own SPF 50, essential for Benidorm's intense UV exposure."

        "title": "Beach Activities",
        "content": "Benidorm's three main beaches each offer distinct character. Playa Levante, the most famous, stretches 1.5km of golden sand backed by the promenade of restaurants and shops—perfect for people-watching and social beach culture.

        "title": "Family Entertainment",
        "content": "Beyond theme parks, Benidorm caters brilliantly to families. The Benidorm Palace, a legendary cabaret venue, stages spectacular dinner shows with flamenco dancers, acrobats, and singers (€65-85 including three-course dinner and drinks). Shows vary nightly—check schedules as some nights feature different themes. The Iglesia de San Jaime dominates the skyline with its distinctive twin domes; attending Sunday mass offers cultural insight even for non-religious visitors.

The Old Town (Casco Antiguo) retains authentic Mediterranean atmosphere with narrow whitewashed streets, family-run restaurants, and artisan shops.

        "content": "Benidorm's nightlife scene transforms the town after sunset, with hundreds of bars, clubs, and beach venues creating an electric atmosphere. The Calle del Arzobispo Morcillo runs through the heart of entertainment, nicknamed 'Party Street,' where international clubs pump house and dance music until 4am. For sophisticated cocktails and quieter ambiance, head to the newer marina area with upscale bars offering Mediterranean views and craft drinks (€10-15 per cocktail). Irish pubs like O'Malley's and Murphy's maintain beloved traditions of live music, hearty meals, and international camaraderie. Gay-friendly venues concentrate around Plaza Constitución, with dedicated bars and clubs hosting themed nights. Beach clubs like Paraiso and Pacha host sunset sessions with electronic DJs and mojitos, attracting diverse crowds. Late-night food culture is essential—local taquerias, pizza joints, and kebab stands serve food until 2-3am.

        "title": "Dining Options",
        "content": "Benidorm's dining ranges from casual chiringuitos (beach bars) to Michelin-approved restaurants. The Old Town harbors authentic restaurants where locals dine—expect fresh fish, paella, and traditional coastal cuisine at €12-18 per main course. Calle Lepanto clusters seafood specialists where morning catches become lunch specials. International options abound for varied tastes: Italian trattorias, Indian tandoori, Thai street food, and modern fusion restaurants. Prices on the beachfront promenade climb due to location (€18-25 for similar dishes), so venture one block inland for better value. Tapas crawls provide authentic social dining—order small plates at multiple bars for €2-4 each, accumulating diverse flavors and mixing with locals over wine. Sunday is paella day—families gather at traditional restaurants for this valenciano classic. Booking ahead is essential for dinner service Friday-Saturday, particularly at waterfront venues. Several restaurants offer menú del día (menu of the day)—three-course lunch with drink for €10-14, excellent value for families."
