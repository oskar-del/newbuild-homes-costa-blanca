    "conclusion": "New-build versus resale positioning represents strategy choice reflecting investment philosophy. New-build yields modest advantages—0.5–1.5% yield difference, superior appreciation trajectories, warranty certainty—balanced against construction phase risk and timeline uncertainty.\n\nFor yield-optimized investors comfortable construction timelines, new-build delivers superior positioning. For risk-averse investors prioritizing immediate occupancy and rental validation, resale offers compelling alternative.\n\nEnvisagez de vous installer sur la Costa Blanca ?
