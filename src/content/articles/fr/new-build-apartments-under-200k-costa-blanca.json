        "title": "Considérations acheteurs & selection strategy",
        "content": "Successful sub-€200K purchases follow systematic approach:\n\nFirst, clarify purchase motivation—owner-occupation versus investment. This fundamentally shapes location, amenity, and property selection.\n\nSecond, evaluate location carefully. Beach proximity commands premiums; inland alternatives offer values. Understand walk-times versus transport dependencies.\n\nThird, assess community fees. Apartment communities charge €150–300 annually; understand infrastructure coverage and fee trajectories.\n\nFourth, inspect properties thoroughly despite new-build status. Verify construction quality, specification accuracy, and builder warranty terms.\n\nFifth, evaluate rental potential realistically. Properties near beach/amenities achieve better rents. Factor seasonal demand curves and management commission impacts.\n\nSixth, consider financing carefully. New-build often enables developer financing assistance or favorable mortgage terms—evaluate carefully versus independent mortgages."
