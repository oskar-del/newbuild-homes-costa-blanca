Operators accounting seasonal demand patterns essential.\n\nCosta Blanca captures northern European winter escapes (octobre-mai primarily) alongside business relocations generating demand variability.

        "title": "Considérations fiscales & obligations taxation",
        "content": "Propriétaires espagnols filing propriété comme revenu—typical approach—report gross rental income declaring 19% taxation linear (standard rate). Expenses—management, maintenance, utilities, agent fees—deductible reducing taxable net.\n\nNon-résidents españoles (propriétaires non-résidents) pay 19% tax also, though withholding requirements apply potentially at property management level.\n\nForm 720 annual filing required if Spanish property held. Rental income inclusion in annual tax returns essential.\n\nDeductible expenses clarify: management agency commissions (18-25% typical), maintenance repairs, insurance, utility costs proportional rental period, advertising costs, cleaning services. Mortgage interest (if financing) deductible as investment property expense.\n\nCapital improvements vs. repairs distinction material—repairs fully deductible year-incurred; capital improvements depreciated over useful life (typically 30+ years residential).\n\nRecommendation: engage Spanish tax advisor (gestoría) pre-rental commencement ensuring compliance, understanding deduction optimization strategies, preventing future audit complications."

        "title": "Contrats de location moyen-terme & protections légales",
        "content": "Spanish rental law (Ley de Arrendamientos Urbanos) governs property leases. Moyen-terme contracts typically less regulated than long-term residential—more flexibility generally exists.\n\nContract essentials: parties identification (owner, tenant), property description, lease term exact dates, rental amount and payment terms, security deposit (typically 1-2 months rent), utilities allocation responsibility, maintenance obligations, and early termination conditions.\n\nDeposit protection required—deposits held in official intermediaries (administraciones públicas or colegio profesional) protecting both parties.\n\nTenant protections vary lease length—leases 3+ months activate residential protections; leases <3 months (often marketed \"furnished short-terms\") enjoy less regulatory framework. Strategic lease-length positioning affects tenant rights materially.\n\nEviction procedures if needed require legal process—landlord cannot unilaterally exclude tenants. Non-payment situations require court intervention potentially extending 3-4 months. Understanding legal process and cost implications (€1-2K legal fees typical) informing tenant screening importance."

        "title": "Assurance propriété et couverture risques",
        "content": "Standard homeowner insurance (hogar) inadequate for rental properties—specialized rental property insurance (póliza de alquiler) required.\n\nRental insurance covers property damage, tenant liability, loss of rental income if property becomes unrentable. Annual premiums typically €800-1500 depending property value and coverage scope.\n\nTenant damage liability—unauthorized modifications, damage beyond normal wear—requires clear documentation pre-lease commencement. Photographic evidence of property condition pre-tenant occupation prevents disputes.\n\nUtility interruption coverage optional—if property utilities interrupted (water main break, electrical failure), insurance potentially covers lost rental income during repair period. Valuable protection for income-dependent landlords.\n\nNon-insurance risk management includes rigorous tenant screening—employment verification, prior rental history, financial stability confirmation—mitigating bad-tenant scenarios requiring expensive eviction.\n\nProperty management companies carry insurance covering their liability; understanding carrier details and coverage scope clarifies protection layering."

        "content": "Owner-management vs. professional management presents trade-off scenarios:\n\nOwner-management: maximum revenue capture (no 18-25% agency commission), direct tenant relationships, flexibility. Requirements: response availability, lease enforcement readiness, maintenance coordination. Time-intensive, emotionally challenging sometimes.\n\nProfessional management: agency handles tenant screening, lease administration, maintenance coordination, guest communication, guest reception/checkout. Commission cost (18-25%) balanced against operational overhead elimination and professionalization benefits.\n\nRevenue optimization strategies:\n\nSeasonal pricing—higher rates octubre-mayo winter season, lower rates junio-septiembre summer when beach rentals competition intensifies.\n\nMinimum stay requirements—setting 1-month minimums (vs. weekly flexibility) attracts different tenant profiles, often more stable renters.\n\nUtility inclusion strategy—including utilities increases perceived value, simplifies tenant experience, enables rate increase offset. €100-150/month utility allowance typical.\n\nAmenity bundling—including WiFi, parking, linens, cleaning services—commands premium positioning vs. bare apartment offerings.\n\nOccupancy targeting 70-75% annually realistic—factoring seasonal demand curves, turnover periods, occasional vacancy-force maintenance."
