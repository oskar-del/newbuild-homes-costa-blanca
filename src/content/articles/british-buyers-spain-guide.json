    "quickAnswer": "British buyers can purchase Spanish property freely as non-EU nationals, but face significant changes post-Brexit including the 90-day Schengen limit, need for visas for longer stays, separate mortgage requirements, currency exchange considerations, and healthcare changes. Understanding these implications is essential before purchasing.",
    "intro": "Brexit fundamentally changed what it means to be a British property owner in Spain. For decades, British citizens enjoyed freedom of movement as EU members. Today, everything has shifted. Whether you're a first-time buyer, retiring abroad, or investing in holiday rental property, the post-Brexit landscape requires careful navigation.\n\nThis comprehensive guide walks you through every aspect of buying and owning Spanish property as a British national in 2026. From pre-purchase decisions through to long-term residency planning, we cover the legal, financial, and practical realities you'll face.",

            "content": "Since January 1, 2021, British citizens are third-country nationals. This means:\n\n**The 90/180-day rule applies** - You can stay in Spain (and the entire Schengen Area) for a maximum of 90 days within any 180-day rolling period. Property ownership grants no exemption whatsoever. Even a £500,000 villa gives you no extra time.\n\n**EU citizens can stay indefinitely** - Your EU citizen friends, French spouse, or German neighbors can live in Spain permanently. You cannot, unless you obtain a visa or residency permit.\n\n**You need a passport, not ID card** - British citizens must hold a valid passport for Schengen entry. EU ID cards no longer work.\n\n**Work authorization is required** - To work in Spain, you need a work visa. Working illegally (including self-employment) has serious consequences.\n\n**Rights were grandfather protected** - If you registered as a resident before December 31, 2020, your rights are frozen under the Withdrawal Agreement. You keep your indefinite stay rights and have a TIE (residence card) to prove it. If you bought property after this date without becoming resident, you're subject to the 90-day rule."

The ownership itself is straightforward. The complications arise from visa and tax implications."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Can I stay in my Spanish property for more than 90 days as a British citizen?",
        "answer": "Not without a visa. Property ownership grants no extended stay rights. You're limited to 90 days within any 180-day period unless you obtain a Non-Lucrative Visa, Digital Nomad Visa, or other residence permit. Many British owners happily manage with strategic 90-day visits (Easter, summer, Christmas)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need a visa to buy property in Spain?",
        "answer": "No. You can purchase property as a non-resident without any visa. However, if you want to spend significant time there managing the property or simply enjoying it, you'll need appropriate visa or residency status for stays beyond 90 days."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the best visa for a British retiree wanting to live in Spain?",
        "answer": "The Non-Lucrative Visa is ideal for most retirees. It requires €2,400/month passive income (state pension typically qualifies) and provides renewable 1-year visas leading to permanent residency after 5 years. Processing takes 2-4 months through your nearest Spanish consulate."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does it cost to buy a property in Spain as a British buyer?",
        "answer": "Beyond the property price itself, expect 10-13% additional costs: 8% transfer tax (8% in Alicante province), notary fees (€600-1,500), lawyer fees (€2,000-5,000), and miscellaneous. For a €300,000 property, total is around €330,000-339,000."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I get a mortgage in Spain as a British non-resident?",
        "answer": "Yes. Spanish banks offer mortgages to non-EU nationals with typically 80% LTV maximum and rates of 3.5-5%. You'll need income proof, bank statements, and a 20% deposit. Specialist brokers can help, and some UK lenders also offer Spain mortgages."
      },
      {
        "question": "What healthcare do I get as a British property owner in Spain?",
        "answer": "If visiting (under 90 days): GHIC card provides emergency coverage. If retiring and receiving UK state pension: S1 form gives free Spanish public healthcare. If younger: Must have private insurance (€60-200/month) until state pension age, then S1 becomes available."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the currency risk when buying a €300,000 property?",
        "answer": "Significant. GBP/EUR fluctuates 5-10% regularly. €300,000 at 1.20 GBP/EUR = £250,000, but at 1.10 = £272,730—a difference of £22,730. Use specialist FX brokers instead of banks (save €3,000-6,000), consider forward contracts to lock rates, and think about ongoing EUR costs for maintenance and taxes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there established British communities I can join?",
        "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Torrevieja has 15,000+ British residents with clubs, churches, restaurants, and services. Orihuela Costa, Dénia, and other areas have smaller British communities. These communities offer social activities, English services, and support networks—though some prefer a more integrated Spanish experience."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rent out my Spanish property to generate income?",
        "answer": "Yes, but understand the reality: Tourist rentals through Airbnb might generate €15,000-40,000 annually, but costs are high (management 15-20%, cleaning, linens, utilities, taxes 19-45%). Long-term rentals are more stable but lower yield. Consult a tax advisor—rental income is heavily taxed in Spain."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I overstay the 90-day limit?",
        "answer": "Serious consequences: Fines of €500-10,000, potential entry ban to Schengen for 1-5 years, record in immigration system affecting future visas, and airport detention. Even small overstays (few days) are recorded electronically. Don't risk it—plan your visits carefully or get a visa."
