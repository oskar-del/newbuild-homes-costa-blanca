Notary fees (1-1.5% of purchase price) are mandatory for all purchases. Property registry fees add approximately 0.5-1% to total costs.\n\nReal estate agent commissions typically range from 3-5% of purchase price and are negotiable.

Quality standards have significantly improved, with most developers adhering to modern building codes and energy efficiency requirements.\n\nDeveloper selection matters critically.

Leading developers include companies with proven completion histories, transparent financial practices, and warranty support. Pre-purchase inspections of completed projects help assess quality standards, finishes, and community development.\n\nOff-plan purchases (buying properties still under construction) offer pricing advantages of 5-15% compared to completed properties. However, this strategy requires careful developer vetting, clear contractual agreements, and understanding of payment schedules.
