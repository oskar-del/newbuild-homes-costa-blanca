Championship courses like La Sella and Villamartin typically have course ratings of 72-73 and slope ratings of 135-140, meaning even accomplished golfers will play near or above their handicap indices. Moderately challenging courses like El Plantio have course ratings of 70-71 and slopes of 125-135, providing reasonable challenge without overwhelming difficulty. Executive and shorter courses rate at 68-69 with slopes under 125, friendly for developing players.\n\nThese technical ratings help golfers understand realistic playing expectations and assess whether specific courses match their skill levels.
