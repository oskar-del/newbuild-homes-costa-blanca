    "quickAnswer": "Costa Blanca North offers luxury living with higher prices (30-50% more expensive), dramatic landscapes, established expat communities, and premium amenities. South provides budget-friendly options, mass tourism, sandy beaches, and accessible family living. Your choice depends on budget, lifestyle, and investment priorities.",
    "intro": "Costa Blanca divides into two distinct regions offering contrasting lifestyles, price points, and investment characteristics. The North, encompassing destinations like Moraira, Calpe, Altea, and Denia, emphasizes upscale living, natural landscape preservation, and sophisticated communities. The South, centered on mass-tourism destinations including Benidorm's budget alternatives, Alicante, and Torrevieja, prioritizes accessibility, family entertainment, and value pricing. Understanding these regional distinctions enables informed decisions aligned with personal preferences, financial capacity, and investment objectives. This comprehensive comparison guides your selection process.",

        "title": "Price Differential: North 30-50% More Expensive",
        "content": "The most significant distinction between Costa Blanca regions is **pricing, with North properties commanding 30-50% premiums compared to equivalent South locations**. A villa in Moraira costing €600,000 might be €400,000 in the South; beachfront apartments in exclusive North destinations exceed South alternatives by substantial margins. This price differential reflects limited North supply, exclusive positioning, and high-net-worth demand concentration. Southern properties remain accessible for budget-conscious buyers; Northern properties target affluent international investors. First-time buyers typically find South locations more accessible. Investors seeking income-maximizing returns evaluate pricing disparities in return calculations."

        "title": "Landscape & Geography: Mountains vs Flat Coastline",
        "content": "Costa Blanca North features **dramatic mountainous terrain** including Montgó, Sierra Cortina, and Puig Campana creating striking landscapes, hiking opportunities, and visual distinctiveness. The geography creates natural development limitations and environmental protection, restricting property density. Northern towns nestle into hillsides with dramatic Mediterranean backdrops. South features **flat, sandy coastlines** with extensive beaches and minimal elevation variation. Southern geography accommodates dense development and mass-tourism infrastructure without geographical constraints. Landscape preference drives significant lifestyle and property-selection decisions. Mountain lovers prefer North; beach-priority buyers may favor South's accessibility."

        "title": "Climate Variations & Seasonal Considerations",
        "content": "**Climate patterns differ subtly** between regions, with North experiencing slightly cooler summers and more pronounced seasonal variation due to mountain influences. Northern elevations moderate summer heat; coastal North areas enjoy Mediterranean breezes from mountain channels. South maintains consistently warm temperatures with minimal seasonal variation, supporting year-round beach activities. Northern winters see occasional mountain snow at high elevations; coastal areas remain frost-free. Rainfall patterns show slight North increase due to mountain precipitation capture. Sun exposure remains exceptional throughout both regions. Climate choice depends on temperature preferences and seasonal activity planning."

These communities feature sophisticated social infrastructure, exclusive clubs, and cultural institutions. Expats typically maintain higher income levels and education backgrounds, creating entrepreneurial and professional networks. Moraira's 80% foreign ownership exemplifies this concentration. Southern destinations feature **larger but less-integrated international populations**, focused on seasonal tourism and mass-market vacation rentals. Mass-tourism areas attract diverse nationalities but create less-cohesive communities. Networking, social integration, and professional opportunities differ significantly between regions."
