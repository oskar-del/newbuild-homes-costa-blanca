    "quickAnswer": "Medium-term rentals (32 days to 11 months) bypass Spain's tourist rental licensing restrictions. Legal under the Arrendamientos Urbanos (LAU) law, they require written lease contracts, 1-2 months' deposit, are taxed as regular rental income, and offer 5-8% yields on Costa Blanca. This is the legal workaround for areas with tourist license moratoria.",
    "intro": "Spain's cities have increasingly restricted tourist rental licenses (VT-licenses), creating a practical problem for property investors: how to generate rental income without tourist rental approval. The answer is **medium-term rentals** (rentals lasting 32 days to 11 months). This strategy falls under Spain's standard rental law (Ley de Arrendamientos Urbanos), not tourist rental regulations, making it legal even in areas where new tourist licenses are frozen. This comprehensive guide explains how medium-term rentals work, their legal framework, tax implications, pros and cons compared to tourist rentals, and realistic yields on the Costa Blanca.",

            "content": "In Spanish rental law, rentals are classified by duration:\n\n**Tourist Rental (Alquiler Turístico/Arrendamiento de Temporada)**:\n- Duration: Less than 30 days (some regions say 31 days)\n- Renter: Tourist or visitor (not primary residence)\n- License: Requires VT (vivienda turística) license from regional government\n- Regulation: Strictly regulated tourist rental laws\n- Taxes: May be treated as business/professional income\n\n**Medium-Term Rental (Arrendamiento de Temporal or Arrendamiento de Corta Duración)**:\n- Duration: **32 days to 11 months**\n- Renter: Can be tourist, temporary worker, student, or someone seeking temporary housing\n- License: **NO license required**—governed by standard rental law (LAU)\n- Regulation: Standard residential lease law applies\n- Taxes: Treated as regular rental income (transparencia/tax declaration)\n\n**Long-Term Rental (Arrendamiento de Vivienda)**:\n- Duration: 1 year or longer\n- Renter: Primary tenant\n- License: No license required\n- Regulation: Strict tenant protections under LAU; landlord has limited ability to evict\n- Taxes: Regular rental income; very difficult to evict tenant\n\n**The Key Distinction**: Medium-term rentals require a **written lease contract** but no government license, making them perfectly legal throughout Spain, even in municipalities with tourist rental moratoria.\n\nThis is why medium-term rentals have become the preferred strategy for investors in restrictive areas like Barcelona, Valencia, and increasingly in Costa Blanca resort areas."

            "heading": "Why Medium-Term Rentals Exist: The Regulatory Gap",
            "content": "Spain's rental law (Ley de Arrendamientos Urbanos, LAU) was designed for long-term housing. When tourist rentals exploded (especially on platforms like Airbnb), cities found themselves with unregulated short-term rentals causing neighborhood complaints.\n\nRegional governments responded by creating tourist rental licenses (VT-licenses) with strict approval processes. However, the LAU statute has a gap: it covers rentals of any duration if there's a written contract. Rentals lasting 32+ days to 11 months technically fall under LAU, not tourist regulations.\n\nThis created an unintended loophole: **a legally compliant rental that requires no license**. Smart investors and residents discovered that by structuring rentals as \"medium-term\" (32+ days), they could bypass tourist license restrictions entirely.\n\nGovernments have been slow to close this loophole because:\n- Medium-term rentals still require a lease contract (more regulated than tourist rentals)\n- Renters are protected by LAU, making management more formal\n- Neighborhoods see fewer party tourists and more stable temporary residents\n- It's harder to regulate without crushing legitimate temporary housing (for workers, students, etc.)\n\nAs of 2026, medium-term rentals remain legal and unregulated in most of Spain. However, this could change—some regions are considering closing the loophole by requiring licenses for all short-duration rentals regardless of length."

For medium-term rentals to be legally protected, a written contract must be signed.\n\n**Key LAU Provisions for Medium-Term Rentals**:\n\n**1. Written Lease Contract (Contrato por Escrito)**:\n- The lease must be in writing to be enforceable\n- Can be a simple agreement or formal contract\n- Must specify: property address, duration, rent amount, deposit amount, who pays utilities\n- Verbal agreements are not legally binding\n\n**2. Deposit Requirements (Fianza)**:\n- Landlord can require deposit of 1-2 months' rent\n- For furnished property: 1 month is common\n- For unfurnished: 2 months is standard\n- Deposit must be held in a protected account or the landlord risks penalties\n- Deposit is returned at lease end minus deductions for damage beyond normal wear\n\n**3. Rent Increases During Lease**:\n- For lease longer than 1 year, rent can be increased by the IPC (consumer price index) annually\n- For short leases (32-330 days), no automatic increase applies\n- Any increase must be stipulated in the contract\n\n**4. Tenant Rights**:\n- Tenant has the right to inhabit the property\n- Landlord cannot enter without 15 days' notice (except emergencies)\n- Tenant can request repairs to habitable conditions\n- Tenant cannot be arbitrarily evicted\n\n**5. Landlord Rights**:\n- Right to collect rent on time\n- Right to non-damage of property\n- Right to repossession if lease ends and tenant won't leave\n- Right to charge for damages beyond normal wear\n\n**6. Duration & Renewal**:\n- Lease lasts exactly as specified (e.g., 90 days, 6 months)\n- If neither party objects, lease automatically ends\n- No automatic renewal unless specified in contract\n- Either party can decide not to renew"

            "heading": "Community Approval: Do You Need It?",
            "content": "**The Question**: Can you rent a property on a short-term (medium-term) basis if you're in a residential community (comunidad de propietarios)?\n\n**The Answer**: It depends on the community bylaws (estatutos de la comunidad).\n\n**Option 1: Community Allows All Rentals**\nSome communities explicitly permit rentals. In this case, you can rent your property short-term without asking. However, you may need to:\n- Notify the community administrator\n- Register the rental with the community\n- Ensure the tenant follows community rules\n\n**Option 2: Community Prohibits Short-Term Rentals**\nSome communities (especially luxury properties or residential-focused communities) ban tourist/short-term rentals entirely. If this is your community, you cannot legally do short-term rentals without changing the bylaws.\n\n**Option 3: Community Is Silent on Rentals**\nIf the bylaws don't explicitly address rentals, technically they're allowed, but:\n- Request community approval at the AGM (Asamblea General)\n- Get written approval from the community administrator\n- Document the approval in case of disputes\n\n**Why Community Approval Matters**:\n- Communities can vote to ban rentals (though existing rentals may be grandfathered)\n- Other owners may object, creating conflict\n- Community can impose restrictions (e.g., \"no short-term rentals exceeding 90 consecutive days\")\n- Failure to follow community rules can result in fines\n\n**Best Practice**: \nBefore buying a property with intention to rent:\n1. Check the community bylaws\n2. Ask the administrator about rental history\n3. Understand community policy on short-term rentals\n4. If purchasing in a complex with rental restrictions, negotiate the ability to rent or choose a different property\n\n**For New Builds**: Developer communities often allow rentals during initial phases (to help owners with mortgage payments) but may restrict them once the community is mature. Clarify the policy before buying."

Legal everywhere, even with moratoria.\n\n2. **More Stable Tenants**: Renters staying 30+ days are typically more responsible than tourists. Fewer parties, less damage.\n\n3. **LAU Protection**: Written lease contract creates legal clarity and dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\n4. **Lower Operating Complexity**: No need to manage frequent turnovers like tourist properties.\n\n5. **Community Acceptance**: Neighborhoods generally tolerate medium-term residents better than tourists.\n\n6. **Legal Clarity**: Regulations are clear and well-established (LAU is 30+ years old).\n\n**Weaknesses**:\n\n1. **Lower Rental Rates**: €30-50/night for 30+ day stays vs €60-120/night for tourist rentals. Over a year, significantly less revenue.\n\n2. **Low Net Yields**: After all expenses, often 1-2% net. Poor standalone ROI.\n\n3. **Tenant Risk**: With medium-term leases, a problem tenant is harder to remove. LAU protections favor tenants. Eviction takes 3-6 months and costs €1,500-3,000.\n\n4. **Maintenance Responsibility**: In medium-term leases, landlord typically maintains the property. In tourist rentals, you control condition.\n\n5. **Regulatory Risk**: Some regions are discussing closing the medium-term loophole. Future regulations could require licenses or prohibit short-term medium-term rentals.\n\n6. **Marketing Effort**: Longer rental periods mean fewer tenant turnovers but also less flexibility. If a tenant leaves early, you may have vacancy.\n\n7. **Tax Complexity**: For non-residents, it's taxed at 19-21% flat rate. For residents, subject to progressive tax rates.\n\n**Bottom Line**: Medium-term rentals are viable if you:\n- Cannot get a tourist license (moratorium area)\n- Prefer stable, long-term tenants\n- Don't need high income from the property\n- Want legal clarity and compliance\n- Plan to hold the property long-term (appreciation is the main return)"

Why Are You Renting?**\n- \"I can't get a tourist license and want rental income\" ✓ (Good reason)\n- \"I heard rental yields are great\" ✗ (They're not, typically 1-2% net)\n- \"I want a passive income source\" ✓ (Reasonable with management company)\n- \"I'm trying to cover my mortgage\" ✓ (Realistic if property purchased cheaply)\n\n**2. Can You Handle Tenants?**\n- Are you comfortable with occasional problem tenants?\n- Can you manage remote (via property manager)?\n- Can you deal with damage claims or disputes?\n- Would you prefer no contact with tenants? (Hire property manager)\n\n**3. Financial Situation**\n- Can you afford 6+ months without rental income (vacancy)?\n- Can you absorb €3,000-5,000 in unexpected repairs?\n- Can you afford extra taxes on rental income?\n- Is this supplementary income or do you depend on it?\n\n**4. Time Horizon**\n- Are you planning to hold for 5+ years?\n- Or do you see this as short-term investment?\n- Medium-term rentals work best long-term (appreciation is main return)\n\n**5. Location**\n- Is the property in a tourist area (easier to find tenants)?\n- Is there demand for 30-90 day rentals?\n- Are there digital nomads, expats, or temporary residents nearby?\n\n**6. Alternative Options**\n- Could you rent long-term instead (1-year lease)? Higher income stability\n- Could you sell and invest in something else (stocks, bonds)? Better liquidity\n- Could you keep it as vacation home? No rental complications\n\n**7. Legal Situation**\n- Does your visa allow rental income? (Non-Lucrative Visa = NO)\n- Does your community permit rentals?\n- Is your municipality considering restrictions on medium-term rentals?\n\n**If You Answered:**\n- **Mostly ✓**: Medium-term rental is worth considering\n- **Mostly ✗**: Look at alternatives (long-term rental, hold for appreciation, or don't buy)\n- **Mixed**: Consult a property advisor before deciding"

    "conclusion": "Medium-term rentals (32 days to 11 months) are a legal, practical alternative to tourist rentals in areas with licensing restrictions. Governed by standard rental law (LAU) rather than tourist regulations, they require only a written lease contract—no license, no government approval. Expected yields are modest (1-2% net), but combined with property appreciation and mortgage leverage, total returns can be competitive. The key to success is professional management (20-25% of rent), clear contracts, proper insurance, and realistic expectations. Medium-term rentals work best for long-term investors holding 5+ years in tourist-accessible locations. For non-Lucrative Visa holders or those needing immediate income, consider alternatives. Consult a tax advisor and property lawyer before investing—mediums-term rental regulations may change, and structuring matters for tax purposes."
