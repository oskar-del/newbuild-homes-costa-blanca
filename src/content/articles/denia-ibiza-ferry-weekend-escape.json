        "title": "Ferry Overview",
        "content": "Balearia operates the primary Denia-Ibiza ferry service, a well-established route maintained reliably year-round. The company runs both fast ferries (catamarans completing the crossing in approximately 2 hours) and conventional ferries (3-3.5 hours). Fast ferries cost a premium (€50-70 one-way) but preserve valuable time on both ends of weekend trips. Conventional ferries (€40-50 one-way) offer better value—the extra hour enables relaxation, reading, or enjoying the onboard bar without time pressure.\n\nThe ferries accommodate 1,200+ passengers and 300+ vehicles, featuring restaurants, bars, lounges, and outdoor deck areas. WiFi is available onboard (sometimes charged), and the views of the Mediterranean crossing are genuinely spectacular—especially at sunset on evening departures. Vehicle transport adds €70-150 depending on car size, though many weekend visitors opt for taxis and rental scooters on Ibiza rather than bringing their car.\n\nHigh season (June-August) fills rapidly; advance booking 1-2 weeks ahead guarantees passage. Low season (November-March) offers greater flexibility and promotional fares that can drop as low as €25-35 for fast ferry crossings. The service operates year-round despite occasional winter swells—seasickness remedies and choosing calmer departure times help sensitive travelers."

        "title": "Schedules & Costs",
        "content": "Summer schedules (June-September) typically feature multiple daily departures—morning (8am-9am) and evening (5pm-6pm) sailings from Denia, with matching return services from Ibiza. Winter (October-May) reduces to 1-2 daily departures. The ideal weekend pattern: depart Friday evening, arrive Ibiza by 8-9pm, return Sunday evening and be home in Denia by 9-10pm.\n\nFare breakdown: fast ferry one-way €60-70 (round-trip €100-130), conventional ferry one-way €40-50 (round-trip €70-90). Children aged 4-11 receive 30-40% discounts; infants travel free. Round-trip bookings save 10-15% versus separate tickets. Online booking through the Balearia website or app consistently provides the best pricing—walk-up purchases at the terminal cost 10-20% more.\n\nTotal weekend budget for two people typically runs: ferry fares (€100-150) plus accommodation (€80-250/night depending on standards) plus meals and activities (€40-100/day). A comfortable weekend escape costs approximately €250-500 per person—comparable to a budget flight weekend elsewhere in Europe, but with far less hassle. Parking at Denia ferry terminal costs €8-15 daily in secure facilities, convenient if you drive from elsewhere on the Costa Blanca."

        "title": "Ferry Experience",
        "content": "The crossing itself becomes part of the adventure. Departing from Denia's commercial port—located just minutes from the old town center—passengers board efficiently with digital tickets scanned at gangway. The port area features a small café and waiting lounge, though most travelers board directly. Arriving early (30-45 minutes before departure) is recommended during summer; winter departures are more relaxed.\n\nOnboard facilities include a main bar-restaurant serving meals and snacks (reasonable quality at tourist pricing), an outdoor sun deck with panoramic Mediterranean views, comfortable reclining seats in the main lounge, and premium cabin options for those wanting privacy or sleep during overnight crossings. The sun deck is particularly popular on evening departures—watching the Costa Blanca coastline recede while the setting sun paints the Mediterranean is genuinely memorable.\n\nArrival into Ibiza town (Eivissa) port places you directly in the heart of the island's capital. The old town (Dalt Vila), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, rises dramatically above the harbor. Taxis queue at the ferry terminal, and the bus station connects to all major resorts (San Antonio, Santa Eulalia, Playa d'en Bossa). Car rental agencies operate from nearby locations. For weekend trips without a vehicle, Ibiza's compact size means taxis and buses cover most destinations within 20-30 minutes."

        "title": "Ibiza Planning",
        "content": "A perfect weekend itinerary balances Ibiza's famous energy with its surprisingly peaceful interior. Friday evening arrival: settle into accommodation, dinner in Ibiza town's atmospheric La Marina district—fresh seafood at restaurants like El Zaguan or Sa Nansa, followed by drinks overlooking the illuminated harbor. Saturday morning: explore Dalt Vila's medieval streets and cathedral, or head to one of Ibiza's stunning beaches—Cala Comte for sunset-facing turquoise waters, Ses Salines for beach club atmosphere, or Cala d'Hort for views of the mystical Es Vedra rock.\n\nSaturday afternoon and evening offer Ibiza's signature experiences: the Hippy Market at Las Dalias (Saturday only) in Santa Gertrudis showcases artisan crafts, organic food, and live music. For nightlife enthusiasts, legendary venues like Pacha, Amnesia, and DC-10 operate through summer months. For those preferring sophistication over club culture, sunset cocktails at Cafe del Mar in San Antonio or dinner at one of the island's acclaimed restaurants (Can Domo, Es Torrent) provide equally memorable experiences.\n\nSunday morning: enjoy a leisurely breakfast at one of Ibiza town's harbour cafés, perhaps visit the Archaeological Museum or browse boutiques in the Marina district. The afternoon ferry departure allows time for a final beach visit or lunch before boarding. Many Costa Blanca residents develop favorite Ibiza routines—returning seasonally to familiar restaurants and beaches while discovering new corners of this endlessly fascinating island."

        "title": "Return Trip",
        "content": "The Sunday evening return crossing provides natural decompression—transitioning from Ibiza's energy back to Costa Blanca's relaxed pace. Evening departures (typically 5pm-7pm from Ibiza) arrive Denia by 7:30-9:30pm, leaving time for a light dinner in Denia's old town before heading home. The conventional ferry's longer crossing works particularly well for returns, allowing passengers to rest and mentally prepare for the working week.\n\nPractical return tips: book return tickets simultaneously with outbound to guarantee availability and secure discounts. Summer Sunday evening crossings are the most popular departure—book earliest possible. If weather concerns arise (rare but possible October-March), Balearia provides rescheduling options and weather updates via their app. Keep your boarding pass (digital or printed) accessible, and arrive at the Ibiza port 30-45 minutes before departure.\n\nFor Costa Blanca property owners, this Denia-Ibiza connection represents genuine lifestyle value. The ability to spontaneously book a weekend escape—or plan regular seasonal visits—adds a dimension to coastal living that few other Spanish locations can match. Several of our clients specifically chose Denia and northern Costa Blanca properties partly because of this ferry connection, recognizing that Balearic access enhances both lifestyle quality and property investment appeal. Combined with Denia's own charms—UNESCO gastronomy city status, Marina Alta wine country, Montgo hiking—the ferry creates a complete Mediterranean lifestyle package."
