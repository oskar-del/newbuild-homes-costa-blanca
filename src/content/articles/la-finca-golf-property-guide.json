        "title": "La Finca Golf Course: 18 Holes Designed by Pepe Gancedo",
        "content": "**Course Overview:** La Finca Golf Resort in Algorfa features an 18-hole championship course designed by renowned Spanish golf architect Pepe Gancedo. Opened in 2002, the parkland-style layout stretches across rolling terrain with mature palm trees, strategic water features, and beautifully maintained greens.\n\nThe course offers 18 holes at par 72, measuring 6,027 meters from the championship tees. Wide fairways welcome players of all abilities while strategic bunkering and water hazards challenge low handicappers. The condition is consistently excellent—La Finca invests heavily in course maintenance, and it shows.\n\nCrucially for property buyers, La Finca is playable year-round. With over 300 sunny days annually and mild winters, the golf season here never really ends. This extended playability directly impacts rental potential—golf tourists visit from October through May, not just summer."

        "title": "Location: Inland Value, Coastal Access",
        "content": "Algorfa sits approximately 15 km inland from Guardamar del Segura's beaches. This positioning is key to understanding La Finca's value proposition.\n\nCoastal golf properties in areas like Villamartín or Campoamor command premium prices—€500,000+ for a decent villa. At La Finca, comparable properties start from €300,000-350,000. The 15-minute drive to the beach is the trade-off, and for many buyers focused on golf lifestyle, it's an easy decision.\n\nPractical distances from La Finca:\n- Guardamar beaches: 15 minutes\n- Torrevieja: 20 minutes\n- Zenia Boulevard shopping: 25 minutes\n- Alicante Airport: 30 minutes\n- Murcia Airport: 35 minutes\n\nThe inland location also means peaceful surroundings. No tourist crowds, no beach traffic—just fairways, palm trees, and Spanish sunshine."

        "title": "Current Developments at La Finca",
        "content": "Several quality builders have developed around La Finca, with Contrimar being the most prominent. Their Oasis Villas series has become synonymous with La Finca living.\n\n**Oasis Villas 2 by Contrimar** is the current flagship development. These modern Mediterranean villas offer 3 bedrooms, private pools, and views over the golf course. Prices start from approximately €345,000 for a completed villa—exceptional value for golf-front new builds.\n\nContrimar has built multiple phases at La Finca over the years, establishing a strong reputation for quality construction and on-time delivery. Their experience with the location shows in thoughtful design touches: covered terraces oriented for afternoon shade, pool positioning for privacy, and layouts that maximize golf course views.\n\nOther developments come to market periodically. The area attracts builders because demand is consistent—golf lifestyle buyers actively seek La Finca properties."

        "title": "Property Types and Prices",
        "content": "La Finca property offerings center on villas and townhouses designed for the golf lifestyle. Here's what to expect in 2026:\n\n**Townhouses/Linked Villas: €195,000 - €280,000**\nEntry-level golf living. Typically 2-3 bedrooms with shared or small private pools. Good for holiday use or rental investment with lower running costs.\n\n**Detached Villas: €300,000 - €450,000**\nThe sweet spot for La Finca buyers. 3-bedroom villas with private pools, gardens, and often golf views. Modern open-plan designs with quality specifications.\n\n**Premium Villas: €450,000 - €550,000**\nLarger plots, 4+ bedrooms, enhanced specifications. Best positions on the course with unobstructed views. Often include features like infinity pools, outdoor kitchens, and premium landscaping.\n\nCompare these to coastal golf equivalents (Villamartín, Las Ramblas): add 40-60% to each bracket.

        "title": "The Golf Community",
        "content": "La Finca has developed a genuine community feel. Residents share a common interest in golf, and this creates natural connections. The clubhouse serves as a social hub—morning coffees, post-round drinks, and regular events bring people together.\n\nThe demographic is international: British buyers historically dominated, but Scandinavians, Belgians, Dutch, and Germans are increasingly represented. Most are 50+, though younger families seeking affordable golf lifestyle are emerging.\n\nMany residents are permanent, attracted by the combination of golf access and lower living costs than coastal areas. Others split their time between La Finca and home countries, often letting their property during absence. The community accommodates both patterns well."

        "title": "Rental Investment Potential",
        "content": "La Finca properties perform well as rentals, with characteristics that favor investors:\n\n**Extended season**: Golf tourism runs October-May, complementing summer family demand. Occupancy potential spans 9-10 months versus 4-5 months for beach-only locations.\n\n**Target market**: Golf holidaymakers are typically higher-spending and lower-maintenance than budget beach tourists. They treat properties well and often return year after year.\n\n**Lower purchase price**: Entry costs 30-40% below coastal golf equivalents, improving yield calculations.\n\n**Rental rates**: A 3-bedroom villa with pool commands €800-1,200/week in high season, €500-700/week in shoulder season. Golf groups often book for 7-14 nights.\n\nRealistic annual gross yields of 5-7% are achievable with good marketing and management. The key is marketing to golfers specifically—general holiday portals underperform specialized golf rental platforms."

        "title": "Living at La Finca: Practical Considerations",
        "content": "**Daily essentials**: Algorfa village (5 minutes) has supermarkets, restaurants, pharmacy, and bank. For larger shopping, Guardamar and Rojales are 10-15 minutes with major supermarkets.\n\n**Healthcare**: Hospital de Torrevieja (15 minutes) provides full services. Local health center in Algorfa handles routine care. English-speaking doctors available.\n\n**Transport**: A car is essential. There's no avoiding this at an inland location. However, running costs are low, traffic is minimal, and parking is never an issue.\n\n**Climate**: Slightly cooler than the coast in summer (a positive for many), similar mild winters. Morning mist occasionally delays tee times in winter but burns off quickly.\n\n**Community fees**: Developments typically charge €50-100/month covering communal areas, gardens, and often pools. Lower than equivalent coastal developments.\n\n**Golf membership**: Various options from pay-and-play to full membership. Annual memberships offer excellent value for frequent players."
