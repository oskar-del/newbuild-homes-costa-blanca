        "title": "Current Market Overview & Price Dynamics",
        "content": "The Costa Blanca property market in 2026 is characterized by strong fundamentals and steady price appreciation. Average property prices range from **€3,200 to €4,500 per square meter** depending on location and property type. Beachfront properties command premium prices of €5,500-€8,000 per sqm, while inland properties in established towns like Torrevieja and Almoradí trade at €2,800-€3,500 per sqm.\n\nPrice growth has averaged **4.2% annually** over the past three years, significantly outpacing inflation and demonstrating the market's confidence. New build properties typically command a 12-18% premium over resale comparable properties, justified by modern specifications, warranties, and customization options. The price differential between off-plan purchases and key-ready properties averages 15-22%, offering strategic investors meaningful appreciation potential during construction phases."

        "title": "Supply & Demand Dynamics",
        "content": "Demand significantly outpaces supply in the Costa Blanca market, creating favorable conditions for sellers and investors. New development completions total approximately 3,200-3,500 units annually across the region, while demand stands at 5,000-5,500 unit sales annually. This supply deficit drives price appreciation and reduces vacancy risk for rental investors.\n\nForeign buyer demand accounts for **approximately 45% of total transactions**, with British buyers representing 28-32%, German buyers 12-15%, Scandinavian buyers 8-10%, and other European nationalities comprising the remainder. This international demand concentration reduces local economic dependency and provides demand stability through economic cycles. New development pipeline analysis shows 8,500-9,200 units under construction across Costa Blanca, with completion expected through 2028."

        "title": "Regional Performance & Town-by-Town Comparisons",
        "content": "Performance varies significantly across Costa Blanca regions. **Torrevieja** maintains leadership with average prices of €3,400-€3,900 per sqm and annual transaction volumes exceeding 2,800 units. Javea commands premium prices of €4,200-€5,100 per sqm due to exceptional location and limited beachfront availability. Benidorm, Europe's largest residential tourism destination, maintains transaction volumes of 2,200+ units annually at €3,100-€3,800 per sqm.\n\nEmerging value areas include **Pilar de la Horadada** (€2,600-€3,100 per sqm), San Miguel de Salinas (€2,800-€3,400 per sqm), and Algorfa (€2,500-€3,000 per sqm). These towns offer entry-level pricing while benefiting from infrastructure improvements and coastal accessibility. Northern coast towns like **Calpe** and **Altea** maintain premium positioning at €4,800-€6,200 per sqm, attracting affluent buyers seeking established communities."

        "title": "New Development Pipeline & Construction Activity",
        "content": "Construction activity remains robust with major developments advancing across the region. Notable projects include Las Colinas Golf complex expansion (€400M+ investment), Paloma Blanca beachfront developments (850+ units), and extensive regeneration projects in established towns. New build completions are distributed across residential, tourist apartments, and luxury villa segments.\n\nQuality standards have increased significantly, with 95% of new developments exceeding energy efficiency requirements (A or B ratings) and incorporating modern amenities including smart home technology, community facilities, and landscaping. Green building certifications are becoming standard in mid-range and luxury segments, addressing growing environmental consciousness among international buyers."

        "title": "Market Forecasts & Investment Implications",
        "content": "Market forecasts for 2026-2028 remain positive with expected price appreciation of 3.5-5.5% annually. Key drivers include continued foreign demand, limited supply, infrastructure improvements including Alicante airport expansion, and new flight route development. Currency fluctuations, particularly sterling-euro exchange rates, significantly impact British buyer purchasing power and represent the primary market volatility factor.\n\nInvestors should focus on undersupplied segments including beachfront properties (limited new supply), rental properties in high-yield towns (Torrevieja, Benidorm), and new developments in emerging growth corridors. Off-plan investments in established developers offer capital appreciation potential while managing downside risk through stage payments and completion guarantees."
