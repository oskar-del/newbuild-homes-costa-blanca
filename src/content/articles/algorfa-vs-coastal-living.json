    "quickAnswer": "Algorfa (La Finca Golf) is 35-45% cheaper than coastal Orihuela Costa. A 3-bed villa costs €300-400k in Algorfa vs €450-600k on the coast. The trade-off: 15 minutes to beaches instead of 5 minutes. Both areas have excellent golf with 4+ courses within 15 minutes.",
    "intro": "One of the most important decisions for Costa Blanca property buyers is location type: coastal convenience or inland value? Algorfa and the Orihuela Costa represent these two approaches perfectly—both offer golf lifestyle living, international communities, and quality new builds, but at significantly different price points.\n\nThis comparison helps you understand what you gain and what you trade off with each choice.",

        "title": "The Price Difference",
        "content": "The numbers tell a clear story:\n\n**Algorfa (La Finca Golf)**:\n- 3-bed villa with pool: €300,000-400,000\n- Townhouse: €195,000-280,000\n- Premium villa: €450,000-550,000\n\n**Orihuela Costa (Villamartín, Campoamor)**:\n- 3-bed villa with pool: €450,000-600,000\n- Townhouse: €280,000-380,000\n- Premium villa: €650,000-900,000\n\n**The gap**: 35-45% more expensive on the coast for comparable properties. A €350,000 budget buys a quality golf-view villa in Algorfa or a modest townhouse on the coast.\n\nThis difference stems from one factor: proximity to the beach. Algorfa is 15 km inland; Orihuela Costa properties are 5-10 minutes from sand."

        "title": "Beach Access: The Key Trade-off",
        "content": "**From Algorfa**:\n- Guardamar beaches: 15 minutes\n- Torrevieja: 20-25 minutes\n- Orihuela Costa beaches: 25 minutes\n\n**From Orihuela Costa**:\n- Multiple beaches within 5-10 minutes\n- Walkable from some developments\n- Promenade dining and sunset drinks\n\nIf beach access matters daily—morning swims, sunset walks, seafront dining—coastal wins decisively. If beach visits are occasional pleasures rather than daily routines, the 15-minute drive from Algorfa is a small price for 35-45% savings."

      {
        "title": "Golf Access: Both Excel",
        "content": "Both areas are exceptional for golf:\n\n**Algorfa**:\n- La Finca Golf: on-site\n- Vistabella: 8 minutes\n- La Marquesa: 10 minutes\n- Lo Romero: 15 minutes\n\n**Orihuela Costa**:\n- Villamartín: central\n- Las Ramblas: 5 minutes\n- Campoamor: 8 minutes\n- Las Colinas: 10 minutes\n\nBoth offer 4+ courses within 15 minutes. The difference is marginal—course quality, membership options, and personal preference matter more than location. Neither area requires compromise on golf access."

      {
        "title": "Lifestyle and Atmosphere",
        "content": "**Algorfa**:\n- Peaceful, rural setting\n- Authentic Spanish village nearby\n- Quieter, more relaxed pace\n- Smaller, golf-focused community\n- Darker skies, more natural surroundings\n- Less tourist traffic\n\n**Orihuela Costa**:\n- Bustling, established resort area\n- Larger expat community\n- More restaurants and entertainment options\n- Zenia Boulevard shopping\n- Tourist infrastructure and energy\n- More activity year-round\n\nThe choice reflects personality: those seeking tranquility and authenticity lean toward Algorfa; those wanting amenities and social energy prefer the coast."

      {
        "title": "Investment and Rental Potential",
        "content": "**Algorfa investment case**:\n- Lower entry price = better yield mathematics\n- Golf tourism extends rental season (Oct-May)\n- Growing area with development activity\n- Value appreciation as area develops\n- Less competition from holiday rentals\n\n**Coastal investment case**:\n- Higher absolute rental rates\n- Broader appeal (beach + golf)\n- Established rental market\n- Year-round tourist infrastructure\n- Easier exit strategy (resale liquidity)\n\nFor pure yield calculations, Algorfa often wins due to lower purchase prices. For rental income certainty and resale liquidity, the coast has track record advantages."

Algorfa requires more planning and car dependence; the coast offers more spontaneous convenience. For holiday homes, this matters less—you're there to relax, not run errands."

    "conclusion": "**Choose Algorfa if you**:\n- Prioritize golf over beach\n- Want maximum value per euro\n- Prefer peaceful, rural atmosphere\n- See 15-minute beach drive as acceptable\n- Focus on golf rental income\n\n**Choose Orihuela Costa if you**:\n- Want beach access within minutes\n- Value shopping and dining options\n- Prefer established expat community\n- Prioritize resale liquidity\n- Want golf and beach equally\n\nNeither choice is wrong—they serve different priorities. Many buyers initially assume they want coastal, then discover Algorfa's value proposition and peaceful lifestyle. Others know they need that daily beach proximity.\n\nWe can show you the best of both areas. Contact us to arrange viewings in Algorfa's La Finca Golf and the prime coastal developments of Orihuela Costa. See both, then decide what matters most for your Spanish property.",
