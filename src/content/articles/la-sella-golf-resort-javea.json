            "content": "José María Olazábal stands among Spain's greatest golfers. A two-time Masters champion, Ryder Cup competitor, and internationally celebrated course designer, Olazábal brings unmatched credentials to course design.\n\nOlazábal's design philosophy emphasizes championship playability combined with aesthetic beauty. His designs challenge excellent golfers while remaining accessible through thoughtful tee configurations. This balance reflects his playing career—he achieved excellence through skill and strategy rather than pure power.\n\nCourse designers fundamentally influence resort positioning and property values. Prestigious designers command premium pricing and buyer positioning. Olazábal's reputation elevates La Sella above typical golf resort status into luxury resort positioning.\n\nThe designer effect proves measurable. Properties at Olazábal-designed courses command 15-25% premiums over comparable properties at lesser-known courses. La Sella pricing reflects this designer premium."

            "content": "Olazábal's designs emphasize strategy over brute length. While championship-length courses demand respect, the difficulty emerges through positioning, bunkering, and green complexity rather than excessive length alone.\n\nWater integration emphasizes beauty and strategy rather than hazard intimidation. Water features create visual drama while shaping playing corridors. The cumulative effect appears natural rather than artificially engineered.\n\nGreen complexities reward precise ball striking. Greens feature subtle breaks and elevated sections challenging precise putting. However, approach shots played to appropriate distances find reasonable putting surfaces—the penalty emerges through distance rather than impossible slopes.\n\nThe course character reflects Olazábal's Spanish heritage. Mediterranean aesthetics—native vegetation, warm-colored fairways, architectural stone—create landscape harmony. The course appears to belong to its environment rather than imposing artificial design."

This variety appeals particularly to club members and resort guests playing multiple rounds—new routing experiences prevent monotony.\n\nThe 27-hole investment demonstrates resort ambition and commitment.
