        "title": "Javea Thursday Market",
        "content": "Javea's Thursday market (mercadillo) sprawls across the Arenal district beginning at 8am and concluding by 2pm—early arrival captures the best produce selection and parking. This enormous weekly event occupies multiple plazas and side streets, offering everything from fresh fruits and vegetables to clothing, household goods, plants, and souvenirs. Local farmers and regional distributors supply produce at prices significantly cheaper than supermarkets—tomatoes, oranges, melons, and seasonal vegetables reflect what's ripe that week. The textile and clothing stalls source stock from Spanish factories and international wholesalers. Many visitors create a routine: browse the market at 9am, enjoy coffee at a nearby café while watching the bustle, then head to beach clubs by noon. Spanish locals intermix with international residents and tourists, creating a vibrant social experience. Parking fills quickly by 10am; arriving by 8:30am guarantees easy parking. Bring a lightweight bag or shopping trolley—most vendors provide plastic bags for €0.10-0.20. Cash transactions predominate, though some vendors accept cards; the Spanish tradition of haggling does not apply to market prices (unlike bazaars), but bulk purchases sometimes yield discounts."

        "title": "Javea Flea Market",
        "content": "Beyond the main Thursday market, Javea hosts a dedicated flea market (rastro) typically on the second Saturday of each month, though dates vary seasonally—confirm timing at the tourist office or local papers. This sprawling event specializes in antiques, vintage furniture, collectibles, and second-hand goods, attracting dealers and collectors across Costa Blanca. Vendors set up from 6am; browsers arrive by 7:30am to capture rare finds before serious collectors monopolize inventory. Categories span furniture, ceramics, artwork, books, electronics, and memorabilia—a time capsule of Spanish and international goods. Haggling is expected and encouraged at flea markets; opening offers are typically 20-30% below asking prices, with deals reached through friendly negotiation. Several international residents use the flea market to furnish newly purchased homes affordably; many pieces reflect previous expat departures, creating opportunities for recognizable brands and quality items. Payment is cash-only, with ATMs nearby but often overwhelmed; arrive with sufficient euros. The market atmosphere creates memorable social interactions as vendors share origin stories of their wares, revealing layers of history and cultural connection."

        "title": "Denia Market",
        "content": "Denia's Monday market (mercadillo) specializes in fresh produce and regional products, particularly red shrimp (gamba roja), a Denia specialty commanding premium prices but justifying them through superior flavor and sustainability. The market occupies the Mercado Central district from 7am-1:30pm, combining traditional produce vendors, fishmongers offering daily catches, and artisan stalls. What distinguishes Denia's market is gastronomic focus—local chefs source ingredients here, and the market culture emphasizes food quality. Tuesday morning adds a dedicated fish market where fishing boats unload directly; visitors witness the supply chain from sea to table. The Puerto (port area) around the market buzzes with restaurant activity, offering convenient breakfast locations where market vendors and local workers gather for coffee and ensaimadas (sweet pastries). Beyond food, Denia's Thursday market (larger event) spreads throughout the town center with clothing, household goods, and crafts. Denia's market culture reflects the town's identity as a culinary destination—time visits to capture both food-focused enthusiasm and the broader marketplace social experience. Parking near the market requires early arrival; many visitors take the short bus ride from nearby villages or park at the marina and walk through charming harbor streets."

        "title": "Calpe & Moraira Markets",
        "content": "Calpe's Saturday market (mercadillo de Calpe) operates from 8am-2pm in the town center, emphasizing fresh produce, local crafts, and artisan products. The market's smaller scale compared to Javea or Denia creates a more relaxed atmosphere suited to leisurely browsing. Local fishermen sell morning catches; fruit vendors offer produce from nearby plantations. Textiles, jewelry, and handmade crafts reflect local artisans; quality often exceeds typical market goods. The nearby Peñón de Ifach provides a dramatic backdrop, with market visitors enjoying the unique geography while shopping. Moraira's Friday market shares similar character—this exclusive village hosts an intimate market reflecting resident demographics (many northern European retirees), with imports including German breads, Dutch cheeses, and Scandinavian crafts alongside Spanish produce. Moraira's market attracts fewer crowds than larger towns; this creates space for genuine conversations with vendors and creates an unhurried shopping experience. Both towns' markets close early—shop by noon to access full vendor selection. Combining market visits with nearby beach time or restaurant meals maximizes efficiency; many visitors structure Saturdays around Calpe market browsing, swimming at Playa Levante, then seaside dinner as the sun sets over the Mediterranean."

        "title": "Shopping Tips",
        "content": "Arrive early (7:30-8:30am) for optimal selection and parking; by 11am, crowds peak and popular items sell out. Bring reusable bags or a shopping trolley to minimize plastic bag purchases. Markets primarily operate Monday-Saturday; check local holiday calendars, as major Spanish celebrations close markets entirely. Most vendors transact in cash, though cards are increasingly accepted—assume cash-only and withdraw euros beforehand. Produce prices fluctuate seasonally; summer tomatoes cost €0.50-1.00/kg while winter imports reach €3-4/kg. Build relationships with vendors through repeat visits; they remember preferred shoppers and reserve special items. Many vendors offer bulk discounts—purchasing a full basket of apples at market price beats supermarket value. Inspect produce carefully; European markets expect customer quality assessment. Wednesday or Thursday is market day across nearly every town; planning a town-hopping market circuit visiting multiple mercadillos creates varied experiences. Saturday and Sunday markets in some villages attract more tourists and tourists-focused vendors; weekday markets reflect authentic local shopping patterns. Finally, arriving after 1pm when vendors begin packing yields significant discounts as they clear inventory—a worthwhile strategy for non-perishable items like crafts, textiles, and housewares."
