    "quickAnswer": "Costa Blanca offers exceptional hiking with coastal walks, mountain trails, and diverse difficulty levels—from easy Mediterranean strolls to challenging peaks like Montgo and Peñón de Ifach. The GR-92 coastal path and internal sierra routes showcase dramatic landscapes and Mediterranean culture.",
    "intro": "Costa Blanca's diverse topography—rugged mountains meeting azure Mediterranean—creates some of southern Spain's most spectacular hiking. Unlike crowded Alpine destinations, these trails maintain relative solitude while delivering comparable vistas and challenging elevations. Whether you're relocating permanently or exploring before buying, hiking connects you with natural landscapes and authentic Valencian culture.",

        "title": "Hiking Overview",
        "content": "Costa Blanca's hiking infrastructure reflects Mediterranean topography—dramatic elevation changes create intense but brief ascents rather than gradual climbs. Peak elevations reach 1,500m (Sierra de Aitana) with most hikes below 1,200m. Distinctive rock formations (limestone cliffs, rocky outcrops) create spectacular scenery and technical hiking challenges. Winter-spring (November-March) offers optimal hiking conditions—cool temperatures (12-18°C), minimal precipitation risk, and clear visibility. Summer hiking (June-August) presents extreme heat challenges; most serious hikers defer summer climbing to early mornings (6-7am starts) with water contingencies. Mediterranean vegetation—pine forests, sage, lavender—provides natural fragrance and ecological richness. Trails vary from well-maintained marked paths to unmarked routes requiring navigation skills. Mobile phone coverage is reliable across most regions; emergency services respond effectively to distress calls. Spanish hiking culture is welcoming; locals recognize hiking groups and offer assistance or directions. Popular destinations attract organized groups; solitude-seekers discover lesser-known routes. Hiking clubs and tourism offices provide route guidance; free maps and detailed route descriptions are readily available."

        "title": "Easy Walks",
        "content": "Cala Finestra circular walk from Altea (5km, 80m elevation, 1.5 hours) descends gentle switchbacks to a secluded pebble beach with restaurants, returns via identical route or alternative coastal path. Suitable for families and recreational walkers. The Punta del Bol Nou loop from Javea (6km, 120m elevation, 2 hours) circles a dramatic rocky peninsula with Mediterranean views, stopping at a beach bar for refreshments. The Denia Marina waterfront promenade walk (3km flat, 1 hour) offers harbor views, fresh air, and café stops without elevation demands. Benitachell's village exploration (4km, 100m elevation, 1.5 hours) leads through white hillside villages with narrow streets, local restaurants, and cultural immersion. These walks suit all fitness levels and create half-day activities combining hiking with cultural exploration. Morning walks before beach time or evening sunset walks integrate activity into daily routines. Coastal walks particularly attract visitors experiencing Mediterranean landscapes without strenuous physical demand. Fixed routes and frequent reference points minimize navigation concern. Typically suitable for children aged 6+; minimal technical difficulty."

        "title": "Moderate Trails",
        "content": "Montgo from Javea (10km round trip, 750m elevation, 3-4 hours) ascends gentle switchbacks through pine forests to a 753m summit with panoramic Mediterranean vistas. The exposed summit meadow allows 360-degree views across Cap de la Nao, offshore islands, and the Valencian plain. A well-maintained path with frequent rest opportunities suits moderately fit hikers. The Sierra de Bernia ridge walk from Altea/Benissa (12km, 800m elevation, 4 hours) traverses dramatic limestone ridgeline between two summits with exposed sections requiring sure footwork but manageable by experienced hikers. Peñón de Ifach (Calpe) circumnavigation (8km, 600m elevation, 3 hours) ascends to a 332m dramatic rock formation dominating Calpe's coastline, descends the opposite slope, and returns via beach path—creates dramatic vistas and intermediate technical challenge. Sierra Helada ridge walk (8km, 500m elevation, 3 hours) from Altea connects valleys with dramatic Mediterranean viewpoints and wind-sculpted vegetation. These trails require reasonable fitness, proper footwear, and weather monitoring. Marked paths with occasional navigation confusion; smartphone GPS apps provide security. Suitable for hikers with consistent weekly exercise; technical challenge remains modest."

        "title": "Challenging Hikes",
        "content": "Puig Campana (Finestrat) ascent (14km, 1,410m elevation gain, 5-6 hours) presents Costa Blanca's most prominent peak, visible from most coastal areas. Steep sustained grades, exposed sections, and significant elevation command respect. The summit reward yields extraordinary perspectives across the entire region and Mediterranean to Balearic Islands (weather permitting). This hike suits experienced hikers with solid cardiovascular fitness; technical difficulty remains moderate despite significant elevation. Sierra de Aitana summit (Alcoy region, day trip from coast) rises to 1,558m—the region's highest peak. An 18km round trip (6-7 hours) with 1,200m elevation gain traverses forests, rocky outcrops, and dramatic ridges. Stunning vistas justify intensive effort. The GR-92 coastal path (long-distance trail) offers multisection options allowing various difficulty levels—some flat coastal sections alternate with mountainous inland traverses. Multi-day hiking packages organize guided traverses with accommodation and meal arrangements. A technical limestone scramble to Ponoig summit (Benissa area) involves cable-assisted ascent on exposed rock faces, requiring specific strength and comfort with heights. These challenging routes demand proper training, adequate hydration, sun protection, and emergency communication ability. Experienced hikers find legitimate challenge; less-experienced enthusiasts risk injury or exhaustion. Professional hiking guides available for technical routes provide safety and navigation expertise."

        "title": "Coastal Routes",
        "content": "The GR-92 long-distance trail hugs the Mediterranean coastline, offering hiking sections with Mediterranean views, secluded beach access, and small village encounters. Multi-section hiking allows choosing distance: day walks range from 12-20km with accommodations in coastal towns. The trail passes dramatic clifftop sections alternating with sandy beach stretches, pine forest passages, and rocky outcropping scrambles. The Cap de la Nao coastal circuit from Javea (12km, 400m elevation, 4 hours) combines dramatic cliff edges with small hidden beaches and Mediterranean panoramas. The Benidorm-Finestrat coastal section features less crowded alternatives to main beach areas; hidden coves provide swimming opportunities during warm months. The Moraira to Teulada route (8km, 200m elevation, 2.5 hours) descends to quiet pebble beaches with excellent restaurants, then climbs back through pine forests. Coastal walks offer distinct advantages—sea breezes provide cooling, Mediterranean vistas inspire aesthetic appreciation, and beach destinations provide natural turnaround points. Tidal awareness matters for some routes; plan to avoid timing changes that obstruct coastal pathways. Photography opportunities abound—dramatic light during golden hour sunrise/sunset creates memorable coastal images. Swimming stops during warm months integrate refreshment into hiking experience. Coastal trails generally suit varying fitness levels by adjusting turnaround distances rather than intensity."

        "title": "Safety Tips",
        "content": "Proper footwear prevents ankle injuries on rocky, uneven terrain; trail-specific hiking boots with ankle support outperform casual sneakers. Hydration planning is critical—Mediterranean sun accelerates dehydration; carry 1.5-2 liters per two-hour hike. Sun protection (SPF 50+ sunscreen, wide-brimmed hats) prevents severe burns at elevation where air temperature doesn't reflect UV intensity. Weather monitoring via Spanish meteorological services prevents exposure to sudden thunderstorms (especially autumn); afternoon storms can develop rapidly. Mobile phone coverage through Spanish providers (Telefónica, Vodafone) is excellent, enabling emergency calls from remote locations. Carry emergency supplies—first aid kits addressing blister treatment and wound care, energy bars for extended efforts, and a lightweight emergency blanket. GPS navigation through Strava, Komoot, or Google Maps prevents getting lost; bookmark routes before hiking and enable offline maps. Tell someone your planned route and expected return time—search-and-rescue response is faster when authorities know general location. Hiking alone carries inherent risks; group hiking enhances safety through mutual support and faster emergency response. Professional hiking guides available for challenging routes provide expertise, navigation, and environmental knowledge. Seasonal hazards vary—summer heat demands morning starts; winter muddy conditions increase slipping risk; spring vegetation partially obscures trail markings. Starting hikes before 9am allows daylight completion before evening descent becomes dangerous."
