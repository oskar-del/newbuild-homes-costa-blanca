These naturally formed dunes reach heights of 15-30 meters, creating dramatic coastal landscapes unspoiled by commercial development. The dunes form a natural barrier protecting inland areas from coastal erosion and Mediterranean storms. The dune ecosystem supports specialized vegetation including marram grass, sea daffodils, and coastal shrubs. This fragile environment attracts botanical researchers and nature enthusiasts. Protected status ensures preservation for future generations. Designated pathways through the dunes enable visitor access while preserving environmental integrity. Dune landscape provides distinctive property positioning opportunities. Developments incorporate dune views into designs, offering properties overlooking dramatic natural features. The environmental protection measures ensure that surrounding landscapes will never be subjected to intensive commercial development, providing permanent landscape preservation guarantees."
