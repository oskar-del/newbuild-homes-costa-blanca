        "content": "Yes, absolutely.

        "content": "**Wealth Tax Reduction:**\nSpanish wealth tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio) applies to property value above €700,000 (varies by region). A mortgage taken at purchase is deductible from this calculation.\n\nExample: €1.5M property with €500k mortgage:\n- Without mortgage: Tax on €1.5M\n- With mortgage: Tax on €1M\n- Annual savings: Could be €5,000-15,000+\n\n**Critical:** Mortgage must be in place at time of purchase. You cannot refinance later and claim the deduction.\n\n**Liquidity:**\nKeep capital available for:\n- Other investments\n- Currency fluctuation protection\n- Renovation costs\n- Emergencies\n\n**Access to Funds:**\nUnlike UK/USA, releasing equity from Spanish property later is very difficult. Get finance at purchase or miss the opportunity.\n\n**Low Interest Cost:**\nWith rates around 3%, the after-tax cost of borrowing is often less than investment returns."
