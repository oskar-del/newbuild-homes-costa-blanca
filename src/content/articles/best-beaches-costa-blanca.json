    "quickAnswer": "Costa Blanca offers 200km of Mediterranean coastline with over 170 beaches. Best for families: Playa Flamenca and La Zenia (south), Arenal Javea and Levante Benidorm (north). Best for scenery: Granadella cove, Cala Capitán, Guardamar dunes. Most Blue Flag beaches of any Spanish coast. Water temperature reaches 26°C in summer.",
    "intro": "The Costa Blanca—White Coast—earns its name from the dazzling Mediterranean light that bathes 200 kilometers of shoreline. But within this expanse lies remarkable diversity: rocky coves where the water glows turquoise, long sandy stretches backed by dunes and pines, lively resort beaches with every facility, and hidden gems requiring a hike to discover.\n\nThis guide covers the best beaches for different purposes: family days, quiet escapes, snorkeling adventures, and waterfront property living. Whether you're visiting to explore or researching where to buy, understanding the coastline helps you find your perfect spot.",

        "title": "Understanding Costa Blanca's Coastline",
        "content": "Costa Blanca divides naturally into two distinct coastal characters:\n\n**Costa Blanca North (Denia to Benidorm)**: Dramatic and varied. Rocky headlands alternate with sandy coves. The coastline rises and falls with cliffs and mountains meeting the sea. Beaches tend to be smaller, more scenic, often requiring walks or drives to access. Water is slightly cooler but crystal clear. More Spanish tourism, fewer package holidays.\n\n**Costa Blanca South (Benidorm to Murcia border)**: Gentler and more accessible. Long sandy beaches predominate, often with promenades and full facilities. The coastline is flatter, development more extensive. Water is warm, conditions calm. Large international community, excellent beach infrastructure.\n\n**Blue Flag status**: Costa Blanca has more Blue Flag beaches than any other Spanish coast—over 40 in 2025. This certification guarantees water quality, safety, accessibility, and environmental management.\n\n**Water temperature**: Mediterranean waters range from 14°C in winter to 26°C in August. Swimming is comfortable May-October for most. Locals swim year-round.\n\n**Beach facilities**: Range from fully equipped (lifeguards, showers, sunbed rental, chiringuitos) to wild and natural. Generally, the more accessible the beach, the more facilities."

    "conclusion": "Costa Blanca's beaches offer something for everyone: families seeking safe, equipped stretches; adventurers wanting hidden coves; snorkelers and divers exploring underwater worlds; property buyers researching coastal lifestyle. With over 170 beaches along 200km of coastline, the hardest decision is which one to visit first.\n\nFor property buyers, beach access significantly affects lifestyle and rental potential. South coast properties typically have easier beach access with more developed facilities. North coast properties often involve drives to beaches but reward with dramatic scenery and clearer waters.\n\nWhichever beaches become your favorites, the Mediterranean lifestyle awaits: morning swims, afternoon siestas, evening paseos along the promenade, and the simple pleasure of sand between your toes.",

        "question": "Which is the best beach in Costa Blanca?",
        "answer": "For scenery: Cala Granadella near Javea is consistently rated Spain's most beautiful beach. For families: Playa Flamenca and Arenal Javea offer safe, shallow waters with full facilities. For natural beauty: Guardamar's dune-backed beaches. Best is subjective—Costa Blanca has a beach for every preference."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are Costa Blanca beaches sandy or rocky?",
        "answer": "Both. Southern Costa Blanca has predominantly sandy beaches. Northern Costa Blanca mixes sandy beaches (Arenal, Levante) with rocky coves (Granadella, Moraig). The variety is part of the appeal—different beaches suit different moods."
      },
      {

      {
        "question": "Are there nudist beaches in Costa Blanca?",
        "answer": "Yes, several official naturist beaches exist including Playa del Pinet (La Marina), sections of Guardamar beaches, and others. Unofficial naturist use occurs at remote coves. Spanish law permits nudism on all beaches, though it's uncommon at family beaches."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the best beaches for children?",
        "answer": "Playa Flamenca (Orihuela Costa) has calm, shallow waters ideal for young children. Arenal Javea offers similar conditions in the north. La Mata and Guardamar have gentle slopes. Avoid rocky coves and strong currents—stick to protected sandy beaches."
      },
      {
        "question": "When is the best time to visit Costa Blanca beaches?",
        "answer": "May-June and September-October offer the best balance: warm water (20-24°C), fewer crowds, and pleasant temperatures. July-August is warmest but most crowded. Winter beaches are quiet and beautiful for walks, though swimming is for the hardy."

      {
        "question": "Are dogs allowed on Costa Blanca beaches?",
