    "quickAnswer": "Non-EU citizens (including UK citizens post-Brexit) can stay in Spain and the Schengen Area for up to 90 days within any rolling 180-day period. Owning property in Spain does NOT grant any extra time or exemption from this rule. To stay longer, you need a visa or residency permit.",
    "intro": "If you own property in Spain but aren't an EU citizen, the 90-day rule affects how much time you can spend in your Spanish home. This Schengen regulation is one of the most misunderstood aspects of Spanish property ownership, particularly since Brexit changed the rules for British buyers.\n\nMany property owners are surprised to learn that owning a home—even a substantial investment—gives no additional rights to stay in Spain. Understanding this rule is essential for planning your visits and avoiding potentially serious consequences of overstaying.\n\nThis guide explains exactly how the 90/180 day rule works, how to calculate your allowed days, and what options exist if you want to spend more time in Spain.",

        "title": "What is the 90/180 Day Rule?",
        "content": "The 90/180 day rule is a Schengen Area immigration regulation that limits how long non-EU citizens can stay without a visa. The rule states:\n\n**You can stay for a maximum of 90 days within any 180-day period.**\n\nThis applies to the entire Schengen Area—26 European countries including Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, Germany, and others. Days spent in ANY Schengen country count toward your 90-day limit.\n\n**Key points:**\n- The rule applies to non-EU/EEA citizens without a long-stay visa\n- Since January 2021, UK citizens are subject to this rule\n- Americans, Canadians, Australians, and most other nationalities also fall under it\n- EU/EEA citizens are NOT subject to this rule—they have freedom of movement"

        "title": "Understanding the Rolling 180-Day Period",
        "content": "The 180-day period is NOT calendar-based. It's a rolling window that moves with each day. This is crucial to understand:\n\n**How it works:**\nOn any given day, immigration can look back 180 days and count how many days you've spent in Schengen. If it's more than 90, you're overstaying.\n\n**Example 1 - Simple visit:**\nYou arrive in Spain on January 1st and stay until March 31st (90 days). You must then leave and cannot return until enough days have \"dropped off\" the 180-day window.\n\n**Example 2 - Split visits:**\n- January 1-31: Spain (31 days)\n- Leave Schengen\n- April 1-30: Spain (30 days)\n- Leave Schengen\n- July 1-29: Spain (29 days)\nTotal: 90 days spread across the year—perfectly legal.\n\n**Example 3 - The trap:**\n- January 1-March 31: Spain (90 days)\n- Leave April 1\n- Return June 1: Only 29 new days have \"dropped off,\" so you can only stay 29 days, not 90.\n\n**The calculator approach:**\nOn any date you want to enter Schengen, count back 180 days and total your Schengen days in that period. Subtract from 90 to find your remaining allowance."

        "content": "This is the most common misconception among non-EU property buyers:\n\n**Owning property in Spain gives you ZERO additional stay rights.**\n\nWhether you own a €100,000 apartment or a €2 million villa, the 90-day limit applies exactly the same. Property ownership is completely separate from immigration status.\n\n**What property ownership gives you:**\n- Right to own real estate in Spain (as a non-resident)\n- Obligation to pay Spanish property taxes\n- Right to rent out your property\n- Right to sell whenever you choose\n\n**What property ownership does NOT give you:**\n- Extended stay rights\n- Automatic residency\n- Exemption from visa requirements\n- Any immigration privileges\n\n**The Golden Visa exception (ended April 2025):**\nSpain previously offered residency to property investors spending €500,000+. This program ended in April 2025 for real estate investments. Existing Golden Visa holders retain their status, but new property purchases no longer qualify."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "Does owning property in Spain give me the right to stay longer than 90 days?",
        "answer": "No. Property ownership and immigration rights are completely separate in Spain. Whether you own a small apartment or a luxury villa, the 90-day Schengen limit applies equally. To stay longer, you need a visa or residence permit regardless of your property investment."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the 180-day period work—is it calendar-based?",
        "answer": "No, it's a rolling 180-day window. On any given day, authorities can look back 180 days and count your total Schengen days. If it exceeds 90, you're overstaying. This means you can't simply wait for a new calendar year to reset your allowance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do days in other Schengen countries count toward my Spain limit?",
        "answer": "Yes. The 90-day limit applies to the entire Schengen Area (26 countries including Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, Germany). A week in France followed by a week in Spain uses 14 of your 90 days. Plan all Schengen travel together."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I overstay by a few days?",
        "answer": "Even short overstays are recorded. You may face fines (€500-10,000), questioning at the airport, and a note on your immigration record. While brief overstays rarely result in entry bans, they can cause problems with future visa applications or border crossings."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I stay 90 days, leave for 90 days, then return for another 90?",
        "answer": "No—this is a common misconception. The rolling 180-day window means days don't reset cleanly. After a 90-day stay, you'd need to wait nearly 90 days before you'd have a full 90 days available again. Each day that passes only 'releases' one day from your calculation."
      },
      {
        "question": "I'm a UK citizen who owned property before Brexit. Do the rules apply to me?",
        "answer": "If you registered as a Spanish resident before December 31, 2020, your rights are protected under the Withdrawal Agreement. You should have a TIE card confirming this. If you bought property after Brexit without becoming resident, you're subject to the 90-day rule like other non-EU citizens."
      },
      {
        "question": "What visa should I get if I want to spend more than 90 days in Spain?",
        "answer": "The best option depends on your circumstances. Retirees often choose the Non-Lucrative Visa (requires €2,400/month passive income). Remote workers can apply for the Digital Nomad Visa (requires €2,646/month). Both lead to residency after 5 years. We can connect you with immigration lawyers who specialize in these applications."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do EU citizens face the same 90-day restriction?",
        "answer": "No. EU/EEA citizens have freedom of movement and can stay in Spain indefinitely. The only requirement is registering on the padrón (municipal register) if staying more than 3 months. If you hold dual nationality including an EU country, use your EU passport for Schengen travel to avoid restrictions."
