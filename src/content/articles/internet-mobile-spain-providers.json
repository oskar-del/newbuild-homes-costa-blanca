Contact Movistar/Orange/Digi directly: Request quote, confirm availability\n2. Understand timeline: When can installation happen\n3.

Backup plan: Coworking space if working remotely, café wifi initially\n\n**Critical question to ask**: \"What is the exact installation date and what happens if delayed?\"\n\n**Reality**: Some expats arrive to unconnected homes.

Whether you prioritize cost (Digi), reliability (Movistar/Orange), or bundled convenience, Spanish options are excellent and affordable.\n\nNew builds offer modern fiber infrastructure with typical 2-3 week installation timelines. For remote workers, 300Mbps fiber suffices; 600Mbps ideal for demanding work. Mobile plans include EU roaming standard, making travel seamless.\n\nSetup need not be complex despite Spanish language barriers—online sign-up available in English, major providers increasingly accommodating. Budget €40-60/month for excellent internet and mobile combined. Within weeks of relocation, your digital life in Costa Blanca runs smoothly, keeping you connected to work, family, and everything that matters."
