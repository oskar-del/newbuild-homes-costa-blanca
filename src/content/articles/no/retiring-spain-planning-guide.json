    "quickAnswer": "Costa Blanca is Europe's top retirement destination. Non-lucrative visa requires €2,300/month passive income (no work allowed). Healthcare excellent via S1 form (UK) or private (€50-150/month). EU pensions transferred easily via coordination rules. Cost of living 40-50% less than UK. Budget €2,500-3,500/month for comfortable retirement.",
    "intro": "Spania has become Europe's premiere retirement destination, particularly Costa Blanca, attracting thousands of retirees annually. The combination of Mediterranean climate, excellent healthcare, low cost of living, and established expat communities makes retirement here achievable and enriching.\n\nThis guide covers residency pathways (non-lucrative visa, EU freedom of movement), healthcare navigation (S1 forms, padron registration, insurance), pension transfers, tax residency rules, realistic budgeting, social integration, and practical timelines. Retiring to Spania is more achievable than most assume—proper planning ensures smooth transition and excellent quality of life.",

    "conclusion": "Retiring to Costa Blanca is increasingly achievable for retirees with proper planning. The combination of excellent healthcare, low cost of living, established communities, and Mediterranean livsstil makes Spania an exceptional retirement destination.\n\nWhether using non-lucrative visa, S1 healthcare form, or EU freedom of movement, residency established within 3-4 months. Healthcare accessible immediately (free via S1, affordable via private). Pension transfers straightforward via EU coordination rules. Budgets realistic: €2,500-3,500/month supports comfortable retirement—less than equivalent UK cost.\n\nMost importantly, thriving expat communities prevent isolation. Golf, social clubs, language classes, volunteer opportunities, and organized activities provide structure and friendship. Many retirees report greater life satisfaction, stronger social connections, and improved health within first year.\n\nStart with location research, consult financial advisor about pension transfers, request S1 form early, and plan 6-month preparation timeline. Within one year, you're established in a fellesskap, healthcare routine, financially settled, and genuinely enjoying Mediterranean retirement that seemed distant when planning began."
