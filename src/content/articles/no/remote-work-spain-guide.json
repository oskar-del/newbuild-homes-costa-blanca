    "quickAnswer": "Spania welcomes remote workers: Digital Nomad Visa (€1,000-2,500/month income), no Beckham Law tax breaks for remote workers, fiber internet (300-600Mbps common), coworking spaces €150-400/month. Costa Blanca suits European clients (time zone compatible). Best towns: Denia (infrastructure), Torrevieja (fellesskap), Alicante (services). Tax planning essential—€25,000-50,000/year employees often see advantages.",
    "intro": "Spania has rapidly become a hub for remote workers and digital nomads. The combination of infrastructure (excellent fiber internet), quality of life, European time zone convenience, lower costs, and recently-introduced Digital Nomad Visa makes Spania an ideal base for location-independent professionals.\n\nThis guide covers visa options (Digital Nomad Visa vs. other paths), tax implications (critical for different income levels and nationalities), Beckham Law implications for employees, internet reliability (crucial for remote work), coworking spaces by by, practical setup (NIE, bank account, tax registration), and best locations for different work styles. Working remotely from Costa Blanca is increasingly realistic and increasingly common.",

More risk than Digital Nomad Visa.\n\n**Reality**: Some remote workers use this, but Digital Nomad Visa officially endorsed and safer choice.\n\n**Option 2: EU/EEA Citizens (Automatic Right)**\n\nBritish citizens NO LONGER have automatic right post-Brexit. Must use Digital Nomad Visa or obtain non-lucrative visa.\n\n**Irish/EU nationals**: Freedom of movement automatic. No visa needed. Can work immediately. Register at padron.\n\n**Option 3: Tourist Stay (90 Days)**\n\nFor short-term digital nomads:\n- 90-day tourist stay (no visa needed for most nationalities)\n- Not ideal for permanent remote work\n- Used for trial periods, short projects\n- Cannot extend beyond 90 days (must leave/return)\n\n**Best for**: Testing remote work livsstil, 3-month projects, vacation + work combination."
