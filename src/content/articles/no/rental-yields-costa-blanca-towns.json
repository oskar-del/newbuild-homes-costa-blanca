        "content": "**Gross rental yield** measures annual rental income divided by eiendom purchase price, expressed as percentage. A €300,000 eiendom generating €18,000 annual rental income yields 6% gross (€18,000 ÷ €300,000 = 6%).\n\n**Net rental yield** subtracts operating expenses including management fees (15-25%), maintenance reserves (2-3%), insurance (€300-€600 annually), fellesskap fees (€1,500-€3,500 annually), and utilities. Net yields typically range 2-4% depending on by and management efficiency.\n\n**Seasonal yield** concentrates income into 5-7 peak summer months (June-September) while winter months generate 20-30% of summer revenues. Strategic seasonal eiendommer maximize peak period occupancy while accepting winter vacancy, contrasting with year-round eiendommer targeting steady international demand.\n\nCosta Blanca benchmarks establish gross yields of 4-8% as market standard, significantly exceeding UK yields (2.5-4%) and northern European benchmarks (3-5%), justifying foreign investor capital deployment."

        "content": "**Seasonal rental strategies** maximize peak-period premium pricing accepting winter vacancy. This approach suits:\n- eiendommer in premium locations (Javea, beachfront Torrevieja)\n- Investors comfortable with 20-30% annual vacancy\n- eiendommer requiring significant annual maintenance/refurbishment\n- Markets with pronounced summer demand peaks\n\nSeasonal eiendommer typically achieve 55-65% annual occupancy at 35-45% higher nightly rates compared to year-round eiendommer. A €300,000 eiendom renting at €2,200 monthly year-round generates €26,400 annually. The same eiendom renting €3,200 seasonally (May-October) and €800 winter generates €27,200 annually with identical gross yield but requiring 6-month management gaps.\n\n**Year-round rental strategies** prioritize occupancy consistency and cash flow stability:\n- eiendommer in high-demand towns (Benidorm, Torrevieja)\n- Investors seeking predictable monthly income\n- eiendommer in emerging markets developing off-season demand\n- Furnished tourist leiligheter with professional management\n\nYear-round eiendommer typically achieve 65-75% occupancy at lower individual rates, generating €1,500-€2,000 monthly average across all seasons. This strategy suits conservative investors prioritizing stability over optimization.\n\n**Hybrid strategies** combine seasonal summer premium pricing (May-September at €2,500-€3,500) with winter long-term utleie (October-April at €800-€1,200 monthly). This approach captures seasonal premiums while ensuring winter occupancy through flexible guest sourcing."
