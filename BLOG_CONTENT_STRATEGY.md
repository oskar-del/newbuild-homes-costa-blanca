# Blog Content Strategy: New Build Costa Blanca
## 100+ SEO-Optimized Articles for Maximum Organic Traffic

*Last Updated: February 2026*

---

## Strategic Overview

### The Opportunity
Major portals (Idealista 48M visits, Kyero 3M visits) dominate on volume but **lack depth** in:
- New-build specific buyer education
- Nationality-specific purchasing guides
- Golf property specialization
- Local Costa Blanca expertise

### Our Competitive Advantage
Win through **depth, not scale**. Target high-intent long-tail keywords that major portals leave on the table.

### Content Pillars
1. **Buying Process** - Complete guides from first search to completion
2. **Location Guides** - Town-by-town deep dives
3. **Lifestyle** - What life is really like on the Costa Blanca
4. **Finance & Legal** - Mortgages, taxes, visas, regulations
5. **Investment** - Rental yields, market trends, ROI analysis
6. **Golf Properties** - Resort-by-resort specialization
7. **Nationality Guides** - Country-specific buyer journeys

## Category Structure

4. **Off-plan risks and protections** (bank guarantees, insurance)
5. **Local Costa Blanca expertise** (specific towns, specific developments)
6. **Post-Golden Visa alternatives** (Digital Nomad, Non-Lucrative)
7. **Investment yields by town** (actual data, not generic)
8. **New development news** (launches, construction updates, delivery dates)

### Quick Win Keywords (Low Competition):
